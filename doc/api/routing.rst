Routing
=======

The *falcon.routing* module contains utilities used internally by
``falcon.API`` to route requests. They are exposed here for use by
classes that inherit from ``falcon.API`` to implement custom
routing logic, and in anticipation of a future version of the
framework that will afford customization of routing via composition
in lieu of inheritance.
