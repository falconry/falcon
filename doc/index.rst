The Falcon Web Framework
=================================

Release v\ |version|. (:ref:`Installation <install>`)

.. note::

  This documentation targets the upcoming 0.2.0 release of Falcon,
  currently in beta and available on PyPI.

Falcon is a minimalist WSGI library for building speedy web APIs and app
backends. We like to think of Falcon as the `Dieter Rams` of web frameworks.

When it comes to building HTTP APIs, other frameworks weigh you down with tons
of dependencies and unnecessary abstractions. Falcon cuts to the chase with a
clean design that embraces HTTP and the REST architectural style.

.. code:: python

    class CatalogItem(object):

        # ...

        @falcon.before(hooks.to_oid)
        def on_get(self, id):
            return self._collection.find_one(id)

    app = falcon.API(after=[hooks.serialize])
    app.add_route('/items/{id}', CatalogItem())

**S. Magr√≠**
    I feel like I'm just talking HTTP at last, with nothing in the
    middle. Falcon seems like the *requests* of backend.

**J. Legler**
    The source code for falcon is so good, I almost prefer it to
    documentation. It basically can't be wrong.

**K. Conway**
    What other framework has integrated support for "786 TRY IT NOW"?
