# Pull Request Checklist

This is just a reminder about the most common mistakes.  Please make sure that you tick all *appropriate* boxes.  But please read our [contribution guide](https://github.com/falconry/falcon/blob/master/CONTRIBUTING.md) at least once; it will save you a few review cycles!

If an item doesn't apply to your pull request, **check it anyway** to make it apparent that there's nothing to do.

    - [ ] Changed/added classes/methods/functions have appropriate `versionadded`, `versionchanged`, or `deprecated` [directives](http://www.sphinx-doc.org/en/stable/usage/restructuredtext/directives.html?highlight=versionadded#directive-versionadded).
