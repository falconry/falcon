Falcon

Overview
~~~~~~~~

|Runner| Come hang out with us in **#falconframework** on freenode.

Falcon is a `high-performance Python
framework <http://falconframework.org/index.html>`__ for building cloud
APIs. It encourages the REST architectural style, and tries to do
as little as possible while remaining `highly effective
<http://falconframework.org/index.html#Benefits>`__.

    Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything
    to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.

    *- Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry*

Design Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Fast.** Cloud APIs need to turn around requests quickly, and make
efficient use of hardware. This is particularly important when serving
many concurrent requests. Falcon processes requests `several times
faster <http://falconframework.org/#Metrics>`__ than other popular web
frameworks.

**Light.** Only the essentials are included, with *six* and *mimeparse*
being the only dependencies outside the standard library. We work to keep
the code lean, making Falcon easier to test, optimize, and deploy.

**Flexible.** Falcon can be deployed in a variety of ways, depending on
your needs. The framework speaks WSGI, and works great with `Python 2.6
and 2.7, PyPy, and Python 3.3 <https://travis-ci.org/racker/falcon>`__.
There's no tight coupling with any async framework, leaving you free to
mix-and-match what you need.

Features
~~~~~~~~

-  Intuitive routing via URI templates and resource classes
-  Easy access to headers and bodies through request and response
   classes
-  Idiomatic HTTP error responses via a handy exception base class
-  DRY request processing using global, resource, and method hooks
-  Snappy unit testing through WSGI helpers and mocks
-  20% speed boost when Cython is available
-  Python 2.6, Python 2.7, PyPy and Python 3.3 support
-  Speed, speed, and more speed!

Install

Usage
~~~~~

Read the source, Luke!

Docstrings can be found throughout the Falcon code base for your
learning pleasure. You can also ask questions in **#falconframework** on
freenode. We are planning on having real docs eventually; if you need
them right away, consider sending a pull request. ;)

Here is a simple example showing how to create a Falcon-based API.

.. code:: python

    # things.py

    # Let's get this party started
    import falcon


    # Falcon follows the REST architectural style, meaning (among
    # other things) that you think in terms of resources and state
    # transitions, which map to HTTP verbs.
    class ThingsResource:
        def on_get(self, req, resp):
            """Handles GET requests"""
            resp.status = falcon.HTTP_200  # This is the default status
            resp.body = ('\nTwo things awe me most, the starry sky '
                         'above me and the moral law within me.\n'
                         '\n'
                         '    ~ Immanuel Kant\n\n')

    # falcon.API instances are callable WSGI apps
    app = api = falcon.API()

    # Resources are represented by long-lived class instances
    things = ThingsResource()

    # things will handle all requests to the '/things' URL path
    api.add_route('/things', things)

You can run the above example using any WSGI server, such as uWSGI or
Gunicorn. For example:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install gunicorn
    $ gunicorn things:app

Then, in another terminal:

.. code:: bash

    $ curl localhost:8000/things

Here is a more involved example that demonstrates reading headers and query parameters, handling errors, and working with request and response bodies.

.. code:: python

    import json
    import logging
    from wsgiref import simple_server

    import falcon


    class StorageEngine:
        pass


    class StorageError(Exception):
        pass


    def token_is_valid(token, user_id):
        return True  # Suuuuuure it's valid...


    def auth(req, resp, params):
        # Alternatively, do this in middleware
        token = req.get_header('X-Auth-Token')

        if token is None:
            raise falcon.HTTPUnauthorized('Auth token required',
                                          'Please provide an auth token '
                                          'as part of the request',
                                          'http://docs.example.com/auth')

        if not token_is_valid(token, params['user_id']):
            raise falcon.HTTPUnauthorized('Authentication required',
                                          'The provided auth token is '
                                          'not valid. Please request a '
                                          'new token and try again.',
                                          'http://docs.example.com/auth')
