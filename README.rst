The Falcon Web Framework
========================

`Falcon <https://falconframework.org>`__ is a reliable,
high-performance Python web framework for building
large-scale app backends and microservices. It encourages the REST
architectural style, and tries to do as little as possible while
remaining highly effective.

Falcon apps work with any WSGI server, and run like a champ under
CPython 2.7, CPython 3.4+, PyPy2.7, and PyPy3.5.

What People are Saying
----------------------

"We have been using Falcon as a replacement for [framework] and we simply love the performance (three times faster) and code base size (easily half of our original [framework] code)."

"Falcon looks great so far. I hacked together a quick test for a
tiny server of mine and was ~40% faster with only 20 minutes of
work."

"Falcon is rock solid and it's fast."

"I'm loving #falconframework! Super clean and simple, I finally
have the speed and flexibility I need!"

"I feel like I'm just talking HTTP at last, with nothing in the
middle. Falcon seems like the requests of backend."

"The source code for Falcon is so good, I almost prefer it to
documentation. It basically can't be wrong."

"What other framework has integrated support for 786 TRY IT NOW ?"

How is Falcon Different?
------------------------

    Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything
    to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.

    *- Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry*

We designed Falcon to support the demanding needs of large-scale
microservices and responsive app backends. Falcon complements more
general Python web frameworks by providing bare-metal performance,
reliability, and flexibility wherever you need it.

**Fast.** Same hardware, more requests. Falcon turns around
requests several times faster than most other Python frameworks. For
an extra speed boost, Falcon compiles itself with Cython when
available, and also works well with `PyPy <https://pypy.org>`__.
Considering a move to another programming language? Benchmark with
Falcon + PyPy first.

**Reliable.** We go to great lengths to avoid introducing
breaking changes, and when we do they are fully documented and only
introduced (in the spirit of
`SemVer <http://semver.org/>`__) with a major version
increment. The code is rigorously tested with numerous inputs and we
require 100% coverage at all times. Six and mimeparse are the only
third-party dependencies.

**Flexible.** Falcon leaves a lot of decisions and implementation
details to you, the API developer. This gives you a lot of freedom to
customize and tune your implementation. Due to Falcon's minimalist
design, Python community members are free to independently innovate on
`Falcon add-ons and complementary packages <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki>`__.

**Debuggable.** Falcon eschews magic. It's easy to tell which inputs
lead to which outputs. Unhandled exceptions are never encapsulated or
masked. Potentially surprising behaviors, such as automatic request body
parsing, are well-documented and disabled by default. Finally, when it
comes to the framework itself, we take care to keep logic paths simple
and understandable. All this makes it easier to reason about the code
and to debug edge cases in large-scale deployments.

Community
---------

A number of Falcon add-ons, templates, and complementary packages are
available for use in your projects. We've listed several of these on the
`Falcon wiki <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki>`_ as a starting
point, but you may also wish to search PyPI for additional resources.

The Falconry community on Gitter is a great place to ask questions and
share your ideas. You can find us in `falconry/user
<https://gitter.im/falconry/user>`_. We also have a
`falconry/dev <https://gitter.im/falconry/dev>`_ room for discussing
the design and development of the framework itself.

Per our
`Code of Conduct <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/blob/master/CODEOFCONDUCT.md>`_,
we expect everyone who participates in community discussions to act
professionally, and lead by example in encouraging constructive
discussions. Each individual in the community is responsible for
creating a positive, constructive, and productive culture.

Installation
------------

PyPy
^^^^

`PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`__ is the fastest way to run your Falcon app.
Both PyPy2.7 and PyPy3.5 are supported as of PyPy v5.10.

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install falcon

Or, to install the latest beta or release candidate, if any:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install --pre falcon

CPython
^^^^^^^

Falcon also fully supports
`CPython <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ 2.7 and 3.4+.

A universal wheel is available on PyPI for the the Falcon framework.
Installing it is as simple as:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install falcon

If `ujson <https://pypi.python.org/pypi/ujson>`__ is available, Falcon
will use it to speed up media (de)serialization, error serialization,
and query string parsing. Note that ``ujson`` can actually be slower
on PyPy than the standard ``json`` module due to ctypes overhead, and
so we recommend only using ``ujson`` with CPython deployments:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install ujson

Installing the Falcon wheel is a great way to get up and running
quickly in a development environment, but for an extra speed boost when
deploying your application in production, Falcon can compile itself with
Cython.

The following commands tell pip to install Cython, and then to invoke
Falcon's ``setup.py``, which will in turn detect the presence of Cython
and then compile (AKA cythonize) the Falcon framework with the system's
default C compiler.

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install cython
    $ pip install --no-binary :all: falcon

If you want to verify that Cython is being invoked, simply
pass `-v` to pip in order to echo the compilation commands:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install -v --no-binary :all: falcon

**Installing on OS X**

Xcode Command Line Tools are required to compile Cython. Install them
with this command:

.. code:: bash

    $ xcode-select --install

The Clang compiler treats unrecognized command-line options as
errors, for example:

.. code:: bash

    clang: error: unknown argument: '-mno-fused-madd' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future]

You might also see warnings about unused functions. You can work around
these issues by setting additional Clang C compiler flags as follows:

.. code:: bash

    $ export CFLAGS="-Qunused-arguments -Wno-unused-function"

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Falcon depends on `six` and `python-mimeparse`. `python-mimeparse` is a
better-maintained fork of the similarly named `mimeparse` project.
Normally the correct package will be selected by Falcon's ``setup.py``.
However, if you are using an alternate strategy to manage dependencies,
please take care to install the correct package in order to avoid
errors.

WSGI Server
-----------

Falcon speaks WSGI, and so in order to serve a Falcon app, you will
need a WSGI server. Gunicorn and uWSGI are some of the more popular
ones out there, but anything that can load a WSGI app will do.

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install [gunicorn|uwsgi]

Source Code
-----------

Falcon `lives on GitHub <https://github.com/falconry/falcon>`_, making the
code easy to browse, download, fork, etc. Pull requests are always welcome! Also,
please remember to star the project if it makes you happy. :)

Once you have cloned the repo or downloaded a tarball from GitHub, you
can install Falcon like this:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd falcon
    $ pip install .

Or, if you want to edit the code, first fork the main repo, clone the fork
to your desktop, and then run the following to install it using symbolic
linking, so that when you change your code, the changes will be automagically
available to your app without having to reinstall the package:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd falcon
    $ pip install -e .

You can manually test changes to the Falcon framework by switching to the
directory of the cloned repo and then running pytest:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd falcon
    $ pip install -r requirements/tests
    $ pytest tests

Or, to run the default set of tests:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install tox && tox

See also the `tox.ini <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/blob/master/tox.ini>`_
file for a full list of available environments.

Read the docs
-------------

The docstrings in the Falcon code base are quite extensive, and we
recommend keeping a REPL running while learning the framework so that
you can query the various modules and classes as you have questions.

Online docs are available at: https://falcon.readthedocs.io

You can build the same docs locally as follows:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install tox && tox -e docs

Once the docs have been built, you can view them by opening the following
index page in your browser. On OS X it's as simple as::

    $ open docs/_build/html/index.html

Or on Linux:

    $ xdg-open docs/_build/html/index.html

Getting started
---------------

Here is a simple, contrived example showing how to create a Falcon-based
API.

.. code:: python

    # things.py

    # Let's get this party started!
    import falcon


    # Falcon follows the REST architectural style, meaning (among
    # other things) that you think in terms of resources and state
    # transitions, which map to HTTP verbs.
    class ThingsResource(object):
        def on_get(self, req, resp):
            """Handles GET requests"""
            resp.status = falcon.HTTP_200  # This is the default status
            resp.body = ('\nTwo things awe me most, the starry sky '
                         'above me and the moral law within me.\n'
                         '\n'
                         '    ~ Immanuel Kant\n\n')

    # falcon.API instances are callable WSGI apps
    app = falcon.API()

    # Resources are represented by long-lived class instances
    things = ThingsResource()

    # things will handle all requests to the '/things' URL path
    app.add_route('/things', things)

You can run the above example using any WSGI server, such as uWSGI or
Gunicorn. For example:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install gunicorn
    $ gunicorn things:app

Then, in another terminal:

.. code:: bash

    $ curl localhost:8000/things

A more complex example
----------------------

Here is a more involved example that demonstrates reading headers and
query parameters, handling errors, and working with request and response
bodies.

.. code:: python

    import json
    import logging
    import uuid
    from wsgiref import simple_server

    import falcon

        def add_thing(self, thing):
            thing['id'] = str(uuid.uuid4())
            return thing


    class StorageError(Exception):

        @staticmethod
        def handle(ex, req, resp, params):

                           'database. It worked on my box.')

            params = {'q': req.get_param('q', True)}
            result = requests.get(url, params=params)

            resp.status = str(result.status_code) + ' ' + result.reason
            resp.content_type = result.headers['content-type']
            resp.body = result.text

                raise falcon.HTTPUnauthorized('Auth token required',
