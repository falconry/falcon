Falcon

Overview
~~~~~~~~

|Runner| Come hang out with us in **#falconframework** on freenode.

Falcon is a `high-performance Python
framework <http://falconframework.org/index.html>`__ for building cloud
APIs. It encourages the REST architectural style, and tries to do
as little as possible while remaining `highly effective
<http://falconframework.org/index.html#Benefits>`__.

    Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything
    to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.

    *- Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry*

Design Goals
~~~~~~~~~~~~

**Fast.** Cloud APIs need to turn around requests quickly, and make
efficient use of hardware. This is particularly important when serving
many concurrent requests. Falcon processes requests `several times
faster <http://falconframework.org/#Metrics>`__ than other popular web
frameworks.

**Light.** Only the essentials are included, with *six* and *mimeparse*
being the only dependencies outside the standard library. We work to keep
the code lean, making Falcon easier to test, optimize, and deploy.

**Flexible.** Falcon can be deployed in a variety of ways, depending on
your needs. The framework speaks WSGI, and works great with `CPython 2.6/2.7,
PyPy, Jython 2.7, and CPython 3.3/3.4 <https://travis-ci.org/falconry/falcon>`__.
There's no tight coupling with any async or database framework, leaving you
free to mix-and-match what you need.

Features
~~~~~~~~

-  Highly-optimized, extensible code base
-  Intuitive routing via URI templates and resource classes
-  Easy access to headers and bodies through request and response
   classes
-  Does not use WebOb (some of us do indeed consider this a feature)
-  Idiomatic HTTP error responses via a handy exception base class
-  DRY request processing using global, resource, and method hooks
-  Snappy unit testing through WSGI helpers and mocks
-  CPython 2.6/2.7, PyPy, Jython 2.7, and CPython 3.3/3.4 support
-  20% speed boost when Cython is available

Install
~~~~~~~
If available, Falcon will compile itself with Cython for an extra
speed boost. The following will make sure Cython is installed first, and
that you always have the latest and greatest.

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install --upgrade cython falcon

**Installing on OS X Mavericks with Xcode 5.1**

Xcode Command Line Tools are required to compile Cython. Install them with
this command:

.. code:: bash

    $ xcode-select --install

The Xcode 5.1 CLang compiler treats unrecognized command-line options as
errors; this can cause problems under Python 2.6, for example:

.. code:: bash

    clang: error: unknown argument: '-mno-fused-madd' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future]

You can work around errors caused by unused arguments by setting some
environment variables:

.. code:: bash

    $ export CFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments
    $ export CPPFLAGS=-Qunused-arguments
    $ pip install cython falcon

Test
~~~~

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install -r tools/test-requires
    $ pip install nose && nosetests

To test across all supported Python versions:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install tox && tox

Usage
~~~~~

We have started documenting the library at http://falcon.readthedocs.org and we would of course greatly appreciate pull requests to help accelerate that effort.

The docstrings in the Falcon code base are quite extensive, and we recommend keeping a REPL running while learning the framework so that you can query the various modules and classes as you have questions.

The Falcon community maintains a mailing list that you can use to share
your ideas and ask questions about the framework. We use the appropriately
minimalistic `Librelist <http://librelist.com/>`_ to host the discussions.

Subscribing is super easy and doesn't require any account setup. Simply
send an email to falcon@librelist.com and follow the instructions in the
reply. For more information about managing your subscription, check out
the `Librelist help page <http://librelist.com/help.html>`_.

While we don't have an official code of conduct, we do expect everyone
who participates on the mailing list to act professionally, and lead
by example in encouraging constructive discussions. Each individual in
the community is responsible for creating a positive, constructive, and
productive culture.

`Discussions are archived <http://librelist.com/browser/falcon>`_
for posterity.

Finally, you can always ask questions in **#falconframework** on freenode. The community is very friendly and helpful.

Here is a simple, contrived example showing how to create a Falcon-based API.

.. code:: python

    # things.py

    # Let's get this party started
    import falcon


    # Falcon follows the REST architectural style, meaning (among
    # other things) that you think in terms of resources and state
    # transitions, which map to HTTP verbs.
    class ThingsResource:
        def on_get(self, req, resp):
            """Handles GET requests"""
            resp.status = falcon.HTTP_200  # This is the default status
            resp.body = ('\nTwo things awe me most, the starry sky '
                         'above me and the moral law within me.\n'
                         '\n'
                         '    ~ Immanuel Kant\n\n')

    # falcon.API instances are callable WSGI apps
    app = falcon.API()

    # Resources are represented by long-lived class instances
    things = ThingsResource()

    # things will handle all requests to the '/things' URL path
    app.add_route('/things', things)

You can run the above example using any WSGI server, such as uWSGI or
Gunicorn. For example:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install gunicorn
    $ gunicorn things:app

Then, in another terminal:

.. code:: bash

    $ curl localhost:8000/things

A More Complex Example
~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~

Here is a more involved example that demonstrates reading headers and query parameters, handling errors, and working with request and response bodies.

.. code:: python

            thing['id'] = str(uuid.uuid4())
            return thing


    class StorageError(Exception):
