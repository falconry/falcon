The Falcon Web Framework
========================

`Falcon <https://falconframework.org>`__ is a reliable,
high-performance Python web framework for building
large-scale app backends and microservices. It encourages the REST
architectural style, and tries to do as little as possible while
remaining highly effective.

Falcon apps work with any `WSGI <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/>`_
or `ASGI <https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ server, and run like a
champ under CPython 3.5+ and PyPy 3.5+ (3.6+ required for ASGI).

"We have been using Falcon as a replacement for [framework] and we simply love the performance (three times faster) and code base size (easily half of our original [framework] code)."

"Falcon looks great so far. I hacked together a quick test for a
tiny server of mine and was ~40% faster with only 20 minutes of
work."

"Falcon is rock solid and it's fast."

"I'm loving #falconframework! Super clean and simple, I finally
have the speed and flexibility I need!"

How is Falcon Different?
------------------------

    Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything
    to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.

    *- Antoine de Saint-Exup√©ry*

We designed Falcon to support the demanding needs of large-scale
microservices and responsive app backends. Falcon complements more
general Python web frameworks by providing bare-metal performance,
reliability, and flexibility wherever you need it.

**Fast.** Same hardware, more requests. Falcon turns around
requests several times faster than most other Python frameworks. For
an extra speed boost, Falcon compiles itself with Cython when
available, and also works well with `PyPy <https://pypy.org>`__.
Considering a move to another programming language? Benchmark with
Falcon + PyPy first.

**Reliable.** We go to great lengths to avoid introducing
breaking changes, and when we do they are fully documented and only
introduced (in the spirit of
`SemVer <http://semver.org/>`__) with a major version
increment. The code is rigorously tested with numerous inputs and we
require 100% coverage at all times. Falcon does not depend on any
external Python packages.

**Debuggable.** Falcon eschews magic. It's easy to tell which inputs lead to
which outputs. To avoid incentivizing the use of hard-to-debug global state,
Falcon does not use decorators to define routes. Unhandled exceptions are never
encapsulated or masked. Potentially surprising behaviors, such as automatic
request body parsing, are well-documented and disabled by default. Finally, we
take care to keep logic paths within the framework simple, shallow and
understandable. All of this makes it easier to reason about the code and to
debug edge cases in large-scale deployments.

**Flexible.** Falcon leaves a lot of decisions and implementation
details to you, the API developer. This gives you a lot of freedom to
customize and tune your implementation. Due to Falcon's minimalist
design, Python community members are free to independently innovate on
`Falcon add-ons and complementary packages <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki>`__.

Community
---------

A number of Falcon add-ons, templates, and complementary packages are
available for use in your projects. We've listed several of these on the
`Falcon wiki <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki>`_ as a starting
point, but you may also wish to search PyPI for additional resources.

The Falconry community on Gitter is a great place to ask questions and
share your ideas. You can find us in `falconry/user
<https://gitter.im/falconry/user>`_. We also have a
`falconry/dev <https://gitter.im/falconry/dev>`_ room for discussing
the design and development of the framework itself.

Per our
`Code of Conduct <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/blob/master/CODEOFCONDUCT.md>`_,
we expect everyone who participates in community discussions to act
professionally, and lead by example in encouraging constructive
discussions. Each individual in the community is responsible for
creating a positive, constructive, and productive culture.

Installation
------------

PyPy
^^^^

`PyPy <http://pypy.org/>`__ is the fastest way to run your Falcon app.
PyPy3.5+ is supported as of PyPy v5.10.

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install falcon

Or, to install the latest beta or release candidate, if any:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install --pre falcon

CPython
^^^^^^^

Falcon also fully supports
`CPython <https://www.python.org/downloads/>`__ 3.5+.

The latest stable version of Falcon can be installed directly from PyPI:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install falcon

Or, to install the latest beta or release candidate, if any:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install --pre falcon

In order to provide an extra speed boost, Falcon can compile itself with
Cython. Wheels containing pre-compiled binaries are available from PyPI for
several common platforms. However, if a wheel for your platform of choice is not
available, you can choose to stick with the source distribution, or use the
instructions below to cythonize Falcon for your environment.

The following commands tell pip to install Cython, and then to invoke
Falcon's ``setup.py``, which will in turn detect the presence of Cython
and then compile (AKA cythonize) the Falcon framework with the system's
default C compiler.

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install cython
    $ pip install --no-build-isolation --no-binary :all: falcon

Note that ``--no-build-isolation`` is necessary to override pip's default
PEP 517 behavior that can cause Cython not to be found in the build
environment.

If you want to verify that Cython is being invoked, simply
pass `-v` to pip in order to echo the compilation commands:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install -v --no-build-isolation --no-binary :all: falcon

**Installing on OS X**

Xcode Command Line Tools are required to compile Cython. Install them
with this command:

.. code:: bash

    $ xcode-select --install

The Clang compiler treats unrecognized command-line options as
errors, for example:

.. code:: bash

    clang: error: unknown argument: '-mno-fused-madd' [-Wunused-command-line-argument-hard-error-in-future]

You might also see warnings about unused functions. You can work around
these issues by setting additional Clang C compiler flags as follows:

.. code:: bash

    $ export CFLAGS="-Qunused-arguments -Wno-unused-function"

Dependencies
^^^^^^^^^^^^

Falcon does not require the installation of any other packages, although if
Cython has been installed into the environment, it will be used to optimize
the framework as explained above.

WSGI Server
-----------

Falcon speaks `WSGI <https://www.python.org/dev/peps/pep-3333/>`_ (or
`ASGI <https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_; see also below). In order to
serve a Falcon app, you will need a WSGI server. Gunicorn and uWSGI are some of
the more popular ones out there, but anything that can load a WSGI app will do.

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install [gunicorn|uwsgi]

ASGI Server
-----------

In order to serve a Falcon ASGI app, you will need an ASGI server. Uvicorn
is a popular choice:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install uvicorn

Source Code
-----------

Falcon `lives on GitHub <https://github.com/falconry/falcon>`_, making the
code easy to browse, download, fork, etc. Pull requests are always welcome! Also,
please remember to star the project if it makes you happy. :)

Once you have cloned the repo or downloaded a tarball from GitHub, you
can install Falcon like this:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd falcon
    $ pip install .

Or, if you want to edit the code, first fork the main repo, clone the fork
to your desktop, and then run the following to install it using symbolic
linking, so that when you change your code, the changes will be automagically
available to your app without having to reinstall the package:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd falcon
    $ pip install --no-use-pep517 -e .

You can manually test changes to the Falcon framework by switching to the
directory of the cloned repo and then running pytest:

.. code:: bash

    $ cd falcon
    $ pip install -r requirements/tests
    $ pytest tests

Or, to run the default set of tests:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install tox && tox

See also the `tox.ini <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/blob/master/tox.ini>`_
file for a full list of available environments.

Read the Docs
-------------

The docstrings in the Falcon code base are quite extensive, and we
recommend keeping a REPL running while learning the framework so that
you can query the various modules and classes as you have questions.

Online docs are available at: https://falcon.readthedocs.io

You can build the same docs locally as follows:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install tox && tox -e docs

Once the docs have been built, you can view them by opening the following
index page in your browser. On OS X it's as simple as::

    $ open docs/_build/html/index.html

Or on Linux:

.. code:: bash

    $ xdg-open docs/_build/html/index.html

Getting Started
---------------

Here is a simple, contrived example showing how to create a Falcon-based
WSGI app (the ASGI version is included further down):

.. code:: python

    # examples/things.py

    # Let's get this party started!
    from wsgiref.simple_server import make_server

    import falcon


    # Falcon follows the REST architectural style, meaning (among
    # other things) that you think in terms of resources and state
    # transitions, which map to HTTP verbs.
    class ThingsResource:
        def on_get(self, req, resp):
            """Handles GET requests"""
            resp.status = falcon.HTTP_200  # This is the default status
            resp.content_type = falcon.MEDIA_TEXT  # Default is JSON, so override
            resp.text = ('\nTwo things awe me most, the starry sky '
                         'above me and the moral law within me.\n'
                         '\n'
                         '    ~ Immanuel Kant\n\n')


    # falcon.App instances are callable WSGI apps...
    # in larger applications the app is created in a separate file
    app = falcon.App()

    # Resources are represented by long-lived class instances
    things = ThingsResource()

    # things will handle all requests to the '/things' URL path
    app.add_route('/things', things)

    if __name__ == '__main__':
        with make_server('', 8000, app) as httpd:
            print('Serving on port 8000...')

            # Serve until process is killed
            httpd.serve_forever()

You can run the above example directly using the included wsgiref server:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install falcon
    $ python things.py

Then, in another terminal:

.. code:: bash

    $ curl localhost:8000/things

The ASGI version of the example is similar:

.. code:: python

    # examples/things_asgi.py

    import falcon
    import falcon.asgi


    # Falcon follows the REST architectural style, meaning (among
    # other things) that you think in terms of resources and state
    # transitions, which map to HTTP verbs.
    class ThingsResource:
        async def on_get(self, req, resp):
            """Handles GET requests"""
            resp.status = falcon.HTTP_200  # This is the default status
            resp.content_type = falcon.MEDIA_TEXT  # Default is JSON, so override
            resp.text = ('\nTwo things awe me most, the starry sky '
                         'above me and the moral law within me.\n'
                         '\n'
                         '    ~ Immanuel Kant\n\n')


    # falcon.asgi.App instances are callable ASGI apps...
    # in larger applications the app is created in a separate file
    app = falcon.asgi.App()

    # Resources are represented by long-lived class instances
    things = ThingsResource()

    # things will handle all requests to the '/things' URL path
    app.add_route('/things', things)

You can run the ASGI version with uvicorn or any other ASGI server:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install falcon uvicorn
    $ uvicorn things_asgi:app

A More Complex Example (WSGI)
-----------------------------

Here is a more involved example that demonstrates reading headers and query
parameters, handling errors, and working with request and response bodies.
Note that this example assumes that the
`requests <https://pypi.org/project/requests/>`_ package has been installed.

(For the equivalent ASGI app, see: `A More Complex Example (ASGI)`_).

.. code:: python

    # examples/things_advanced.py

    import logging
    import uuid
    from wsgiref import simple_server

    import falcon

            return [{'id': str(uuid.uuid4()), 'color': 'green'}]

        def add_thing(self, thing):
            thing['id'] = str(uuid.uuid4())
            return thing


    class StorageError(Exception):

        @staticmethod
        def handle(ex, req, resp, params):

        }

            url = self.engines[engine]
            params = {'q': req.get_param('q', True)}
            result = requests.get(url, params=params)

            resp.status = str(result.status_code) + ' ' + result.reason
            resp.content_type = result.headers['content-type']
            resp.text = result.text


    class AuthMiddleware:

        def process_request(self, req, resp):
            token = req.get_header('Authorization')

        def _token_is_valid(self, token, account_id):
            return True  # Suuuuuure it's valid...


    class RequireJSON:

        def process_request(self, req, resp):
            if not req.client_accepts_json:

    # Useful for debugging problems in your API; works with pdb.set_trace(). You
    # can also use Gunicorn to host your app. Gunicorn can be configured to
    # auto-restart workers when it detects a code change, and it also works
    # with pdb.
    if __name__ == '__main__':
        httpd = simple_server.make_server('127.0.0.1', 8000, app)
        httpd.serve_forever()

Again this code uses wsgiref, but you can also run the above example using
any WSGI server, such as uWSGI or Gunicorn. For example:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install requests gunicorn
    $ gunicorn things:app

On Windows you can run Gunicorn and uWSGI via WSL, or you might try Waitress:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install requests waitress
    $ waitress-serve --port=8000 things:app

To test this example, open another terminal and run:

.. code:: bash

    $ http localhost:8000/1/things authorization:custom-token

You can also view the the application configuration from the CLI via the
``falcon-inspect-app`` script that is bundled with the framework:

.. code:: bash

    falcon-inspect-app things_advanced:app

A More Complex Example (ASGI)
-----------------------------

Here's the ASGI version of the app from above. Note that it uses the
`httpx <https://pypi.org/project/httpx/>`_ package in lieu of
`requests <https://pypi.org/project/requests/>`_.
