Changelog for Falcon 3.1.3
==========================

Summary
-------

This is a minor bugfix release that only pins the ``pytest-asyncio`` test
dependency in order to prevent an incompatible version from interfering with
the build workflow.

This release is otherwise identical to :doc:`Falcon 3.1.2 <3.1.2>`.
