Changelog for Falcon 3.1.1
==========================

Summary
-------

This is a minor point release addressing a couple of high impact bugs,
and enabling the framework on the recently released CPython 3.11.


Changes to Supported Platforms
------------------------------

- Falcon is now functional on CPython 3.11.
  Full 3.11 support (including taking care of stdlib deprecations)
  will be formalized in Falcon 4.0.
- As with the previous release, Python 3.5 & 3.6 remain deprecated and
  will no longer be supported in Falcon 4.0.


Fixed
-----

- Request attributes :attr:`~falcon.Request.forwarded_scheme` and
  :attr:`~falcon.Request.forwarded_host` now no longer raise an ``IndexError``
  while processing an invalid or empty ``Forwarded`` header. (`#2043 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2043>`__)
- The ``orjson`` library now works correctly when used as JSON serializer in
  the media handlers in the ASGI version of Falcon. (`#2100 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2100>`__)
