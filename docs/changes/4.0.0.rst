Changelog for Falcon 4.0.0
==========================

Summary
-------

The alpha release of Falcon 4.0.0 is here!

We would really appreciate if you could help with early testing on your code!
You can grab this release from PyPI (``pip install falcon==4.0.0a2``),
and :ref:`let us know how it went <chat>`!

Although we are still in the process of polishing the last items from the
`version 4.0 milestone <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/milestone/34>`__,
we do not expect (m)any radical changes from now on until Falcon 4.0.0 final.
The full changelog of new features, breaking changes and fixes will be rendered
as part of the first beta release.


Changes to Supported Platforms
------------------------------

- CPython 3.11 is now fully supported.
  (`#2072 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2072>`__)
- CPython 3.12 is now fully supported.
  (`#2196 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2196>`__)
- CPython 3.13 is now fully supported.
  (`#2258 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2258>`__)
- End-of-life Python 3.5, 3.6 & 3.7 are no longer supported.
  (`#2074 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/pull/2074>`__,
  `#2273 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/pull/2273>`__)
- Soon end-of-life Python 3.8 is no longer actively supported, but
  the framework should still continue to install from source and function.
- The Falcon 4.x series is guaranteed to support CPython 3.10 and
  PyPy3.10 (v7.3.16).
  This means that we may drop the support for Python 3.8 & 3.9 altogether in a
  later 4.x release, especially if we are faced with incompatible ecosystem
  changes in typing, Cython, etc.

Typing support
--------------

Type checking support was introduced in version 4.0. While most of the library is
now typed, further type annotations may be added throughout the 4.x release cycle.
To improve them, we may introduce changes to the typing that do not affect
runtime behavior, but may surface new or different errors with type checkers.

.. role:: python(code)
    :language: python

.. note::
    All undocumented type aliases coming from ``falcon._typing`` are considered
    private to the framework itself, and not meant for annotating applications
    using Falcon. To that end, it is advisable to only use classes from the
    public interface, and public aliases from :mod:`falcon.typing`, e.g.:

    .. code-block:: python

        class MyResource:
            def on_get(self, req: falcon.Request, resp: falcon.Response) -> None:
                resp.media = {'message': 'Hello, World!'}

    If you still decide to reuse the private aliases anyway, they should
    preferably be imported inside :python:`if TYPE_CHECKING:` blocks in order
    to avoid possible runtime errors after an update.
    Also, make sure to :ref:`let us know <chat>` which essential aliases are
    missing from the public interface!
