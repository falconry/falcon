- CPython 3.11 is now fully supported. (`#2072 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2072>`__)
- CPython 3.12 is now fully supported. (`#2196 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2196>`__)

- Python 3.7 is no longer actively supported, but the framework should still

  later in the 4.x series if we are faced with incompatible ecosystem changes
