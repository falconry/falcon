Changelog for Falcon 4.0.0
==========================

Summary
-------

Falcon 4.0 is in development. The progress is tracked via the
`Version 4.0 milestone <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/milestone/34>`__
on GitHub.


Changes to Supported Platforms
------------------------------

- CPython 3.11 is now fully supported. (`#2072 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2072>`__)
- CPython 3.12 is now fully supported. (`#2196 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2196>`__)
- CPython 3.13 is now fully supported. (`#2258 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2258>`__)
- End-of-life Python 3.5, 3.6 & 3.7 are no longer supported. (`#2074 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/pull/2074>`__, `#2273 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/pull/2273>`__)
- Soon end-of-life Python 3.8 is no longer actively supported, but
  the framework should still continue to install from source and function.
- The Falcon 4.x series is guaranteed to support CPython 3.10 and
  PyPy3.10 (v7.3.16).
  This means that we may drop the support for Python 3.8 & 3.9 altogether in a
  later 4.x release, especially if we are faced with incompatible ecosystem
  changes in typing, Cython, etc.
