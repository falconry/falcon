Changelog for Falcon 2.0.0
==========================

Breaking Changes
----------------

- :attr:`falcon.testing.Result.json` now returns ``None`` when the response body is
  empty, rather than raising an error.
- :meth:`~.Request.get_param_as_bool` now defaults to treating valueless
  parameters as truthy, rather than falsy. ``None`` is still returned
  by default when the parameter is altogether missing.
- :meth:`~.Request.get_param_as_bool` no longer raises an error for a
  valueless parameter when the ``blank_as_true`` keyword argument is ``False``.
  Instead, ``False`` is simply returned in that case.
- :attr:`~.RequestOptions.keep_blank_qs_values` now defaults to ``True``
  instead of ``False``.
- :attr:`~.RequestOptions.auto_parse_qs_csv` now defaults to ``False``
  instead of ``True``.
- Request :attr:`~.Request.context_type` was changed from dict to a subclass of
  dict.
- Response :attr:`~.Response.context_type` was changed from dict to a subclass
  of dict.

Changes to Supported Platforms
------------------------------

New & Improved
--------------

- Added a new :attr:`~.Response.headers` property to the :class:`~.Response` class.
- Removed :py:mod:`six` from deps.
- Request :attr:`~.Request.context_type` now defaults to a bare class allowing
  to set attributes on the request context object::

    # Before
    req.context['role'] = 'trial'
    req.context['user'] = 'guest'

    # Falcon 2.0
    req.context.role = 'trial'
    req.context.user = 'guest'

  To ease the migration path, the previous behavior is supported by subclassing
  dict, however, as of Falcon 2.0, the dict context interface is considered
  deprecated, and may be removed in a future release. It is also noteworthy
  that object attributes and dict items are not automagically linked in any
  special way, and setting one does not affect the other.

  Applications can work around this change by explicitly overriding
  :attr:`~.Request.context_type` to dict.

- Response :attr:`~.Response.context_type` now defaults to a bare class allowing
  to set attributes on the response context object::

    # Before
    resp.context['cache_strategy'] = 'lru'

    # Falcon 2.0
    resp.context.cache_strategy = 'lru'
