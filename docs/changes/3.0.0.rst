Changelog for Falcon 3.0.0
==========================

Summary
-------

Changes to Supported Platforms
------------------------------

- Starting with Falcon 3.0, Python 2 is no longer supported. Therefore,
  support for CPython 2.7 and PyPy2.7 was removed in this release. We will
  continue to maintain the Falcon 2.x series for those who still need
  to run under Python 2, at least until that platform's scheduled
  EOL (January 1, 2020 at the time of this writing; see also PEP 373).
- Python 3.4 has now reached its end-of-life per PEP 429, and as a result
  is no longer supported as of Falcon 3.0.

Breaking Changes
----------------

- Header-related methods of the :class:`~.Response` class no longer coerce
  the passed header name to a string via ``str()``.
