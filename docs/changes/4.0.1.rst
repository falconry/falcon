Changelog for Falcon 4.0.1
==========================

Summary
-------

This is a minor point release addressing a Python distribution issue in
Falcon 4.0.0.


Fixed
-----

- Installing Falcon 4.0.0 unexpectedly copies many unintended directories from the
  source tree to the venv's ``site-packages``. This issue has been rectified, and
  our CI has been extended with new tests (that verify what is actually installed
  from the distribution) to make sure this regression does not resurface. (`#2384 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2384>`__)
