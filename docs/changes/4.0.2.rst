Changelog for Falcon 4.0.2
==========================

Summary
-------

This is a minor point release to fix some missed re-exports for type checkers.
In addition, we have also included a couple of documentation improvements.


Fixed
-----

- Running Mypy on code that uses parts of ``falcon.testing``
  would previously lead to errors like::

    Name "falcon.testing.TestClient" is not defined

  This has been fixed by explicitly exporting the names that are
  imported into the ``falcon.testing`` namespace. (`#2387 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2387>`__)


Misc
----

- The printable PDF version of our documentation was enabled on Read the Docs. (`#2365 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2365>`__)
