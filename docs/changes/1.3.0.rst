- A number of attributes were added to :class:`falcon.Request` to
  expose information added by proxies in front of the application
  server. These include the `forwarded`, `forwarded_uri`,
  `forwarded_scheme`, `forwarded_host`, and `forwarded_prefix`
  attribute. The `prefix` attribute was also added as part of this
  work.
