Changelog for Falcon 3.0.1
==========================

Summary
-------

This is a minor point release to take care of a couple of bugs that we did
not catch for 3.0.0.

Fixed
-----

- The ``api_helpers`` module was re-added, since it was renamed to
  ``app_helpers`` (and effectively removed) without announcing a corresponding
  breaking change.
  This module is now considered deprecated, and will be removed in a future
  Falcon version. (`#1902 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/1902>`__)
- ASGI HTTP headers were treated as UTF-8 encoded, not taking the incompatibility
  with WSGI and porting of WSGI applications into consideration.
  This was fixed, and ASGI headers are now decoded and encoded as ISO-8859-1. (`#1911 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/1911>`__)
