Changelog for Falcon 4.2.0
==========================

Summary
-------

Falcon 4.2 is in development. The progress is tracked via the
`Version 4.2 milestone <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/milestone/44>`__
on GitHub.


Changes to Supported Platforms
------------------------------

- The end-of-life Python 3.8 is no longer supported.
  (`#2527 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2527>`__)

- Although the Falcon 4.x series is only guaranteed to support Python 3.10+,
  this release still supports the end-of-life Python 3.9 at runtime using the
  pure Python wheel.

  (Note that 3.9 is completely unsupported for new development of Falcon apps,
  as type checking, building documentation, etc, are likely to fail outright.)

- Pre-compiled wheels are no longer provided for the macOS x86_64 (Intel) platform.
  Falcon will continue to :ref:`install <install>` (from the pure Python wheel)
  and run on macOS Intel just fine.
  You can also build the binary from *sdist* yourself.
  (`#2536 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2536>`__)
