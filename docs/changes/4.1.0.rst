Changelog for Falcon 4.1.0
==========================

Summary
-------

Falcon 4.1 is in development. The progress is tracked via the
`Version 4.1 milestone <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/milestone/41>`__
on GitHub.


.. Changes to Supported Platforms
.. ------------------------------

.. NOTE(vytas): No changes to the supported platforms (yet).

.. towncrier release notes start


Misc
----

- Running mypy on code that uses parts of ``falcon.testing`` naively
  would lead to errors like::

    Name "falcon.testing.TestClient" is not defined

  This has been fixed by explicitly exporting the names that are
  imported in the ``falcon.testing`` namespace. (`#2387 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2387>`__)
