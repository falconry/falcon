on GitHub.


Changes to Supported Platforms
------------------------------

.. towncrier release notes start


Misc
----

- Running mypy on code that uses parts of ``falcon.testing`` naively
  would lead to errors like::

    Name "falcon.testing.TestClient" is not defined

  This has been fixed by explicitly exporting the names that are
  imported in the ``falcon.testing`` namespace. (`#2387 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2387>`__)
- New FAQ Entry on Error Tracebacks in ASGI Applications
  -----------------------------------------------------

  Added a new FAQ entry explaining why error tracebacks do not appear 
  in ASGI applications by default when using Falcon. The ASGI tutorial 
  has been updated to include instructions on configuring logging to 
  capture error tracebacks. (`#2393 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2393>`__) (`#2393 <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/issues/2393>`__)
