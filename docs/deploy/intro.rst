Preamble & Disclaimer
=====================

Falcon conforms to the standard `WSGI protocol`_ that most Python web applications
have been using since 2003. If you have deployed Python applications like
Django, Flask, or others, you will find yourself quite at home with Falcon and
your standard Apache/mod_wsgi, gunicorn, or other wsgi servers should suffice.
In addition, there is a wide breath of articles, tutorials, blogs, security
advice, and best pracitices for deploying Python apps. Please read them.

The aim of these quickstart is to get you up and running not to give you a
perfectly tuned or secure environment. Best effort is made that is all. There
are many ways to deploy a Python applications and these quickstarts might not be
best if your application has special requiments. Use these, but use with care.
