Quickstart
==========

If you haven't done so already, please take a moment to
:ref:`install <install>` the Falcon web framework before
continuing.

Learning by Example
-------------------

Here is a simple example from Falcon's README, showing how to get
started writing an API:

.. code:: python

    # things.py

    # Let's get this party started!
    import falcon


    # Falcon follows the REST architectural style, meaning (among
    # other things) that you think in terms of resources and state
    # transitions, which map to HTTP verbs.
    class ThingsResource(object):
        def on_get(self, req, resp):
            """Handles GET requests"""
            resp.status = falcon.HTTP_200  # This is the default status
            resp.body = ('\nTwo things awe me most, the starry sky '
                         'above me and the moral law within me.\n'
                         '\n'
                         '    ~ Immanuel Kant\n\n')

    # falcon.API instances are callable WSGI apps
    app = falcon.API()

    # Resources are represented by long-lived class instances
    things = ThingsResource()

    # things will handle all requests to the '/things' URL path
    app.add_route('/things', things)

You can run the above example using any WSGI server, such as uWSGI
or Gunicorn. For example:

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install gunicorn
    $ gunicorn things:app

On Windows where Gunicorn and uWSGI don't work yet you can use Waitress server

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install waitress
    $ waitress-serve --port=8000 things:app
    
Then, in another terminal:

.. code:: bash

    $ curl localhost:8000/things

Curl is a bit of a pain to use, so let's install
`HTTPie <https://github.com/jkbr/httpie>`_ and use it from now on.

.. code:: bash

    $ pip install --upgrade httpie
    $ http localhost:8000/things

More Features

Here is a more involved example that demonstrates reading headers and query
parameters, handling errors, and working with request and response bodies.
