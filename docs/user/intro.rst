Introduction
============

    Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything
    to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.

`Falcon <https://falconframework.org>`__ is a reliable,
high-performance Python web framework for building
large-scale app backends and microservices. It encourages the REST
architectural style, and tries to do as little as possible while
remaining highly effective.

Falcon apps work with any WSGI server, and run like a champ under
CPython 3.5+ and PyPy 3.5+.

Features
--------

Falcon tries to do as little as possible while remaining highly effective.

- :ref:`ASGI, WSGI <app>`, and :ref:`WebSocket <ws>` support
- Native ``asyncio`` support
- No reliance on magic globals for routing and state management
- Stable interfaces with an emphasis on backwards-compatibility
- Simple API modeling through centralized RESTful :ref:`routing <routing>`
- Highly-optimized, extensible code base
- Easy access to headers and bodies through :ref:`request and response <rr>`
  objects
- DRY request processing via :ref:`middleware <middleware>` components and hooks
- Strict adherence to RFCs
- Idiomatic :ref:`HTTP error <errors>` responses
- Straightforward exception handling
- Snappy :ref:`testing <testing>` with WSGI/ASGI helpers and mocks
- CPython 3.5+ and PyPy 3.5+ support

How is Falcon different?
------------------------

We designed Falcon to support the demanding needs of large-scale
microservices and responsive app backends. Falcon complements more
general Python web frameworks by providing bare-metal performance,
reliability, and flexibility wherever you need it.

**Fast.** Same hardware, more requests. Falcon turns around
requests several times faster than most other Python frameworks. For
an extra speed boost, Falcon compiles itself with Cython when
available, and also works well with `PyPy <https://pypy.org>`__.
Considering a move to another programming language? Benchmark with
Falcon + PyPy first.

**Reliable.** We go to great lengths to avoid introducing
breaking changes, and when we do they are fully documented and only
introduced (in the spirit of
`SemVer <http://semver.org/>`__) with a major version
increment. The code is rigorously tested with numerous inputs and we
require 100% coverage at all times. Falcon does not depend on any
external Python packages.

**Debuggable.** Falcon eschews magic. It's easy to tell which inputs lead to
which outputs. To avoid incentivizing the use of hard-to-debug global state,
Falcon does not use decorators to define routes. Unhandled exceptions are never
encapsulated or masked. Potentially surprising behaviors, such as automatic
request body parsing, are well-documented and disabled by default. Finally, we
take care to keep logic paths within the framework simple, shallow and
understandable. All of this makes it easier to reason about the code and to
debug edge cases in large-scale deployments.

**Flexible.** Falcon leaves a lot of decisions and i`mplementation
details to you, the API developer. This gives you a lot of freedom to
customize and tune your implementation. Due to Falcon's minimalist
design, Python community members are free to independently innovate on
`Falcon add-ons and complementary packages <https://github.com/falconry/falcon/wiki>`__.

About Apache 2.0
