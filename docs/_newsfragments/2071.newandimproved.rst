Added the :attr:`~.CompiledRouterOptions.allow_on_request` router option that
allows for providing a default responder by defining `on_request()` on the 
resource. This option is disabled by default. If enabled, `on_request()` is
set as the responder for every unimplemented method except for `on_options()`. 
If the option is disabled or `on_request()` is not provided in the resource,
the default responder for "405 Method Not Allowed" is used.
