A new router option, :attr:`~.CompiledRouterOptions.default_to_on_request`, was
added for providing a default responder by implementing ``on_request()`` on
resources (the new option is disabled by default). When enabled,
``on_request()`` is used as the default responder for every unimplemented HTTP
verb except ``on_options()`` (and the special ``on_websocket`` handler).

When the option is disabled, or the ``on_request()`` method is not implemented,
the default responder for
:class:`"405 Method Not Allowed" <falcon.HTTPMethodNotAllowed>` is used.
