If :attr:`RequestOptions.strip_url_path_trailing_slash
<falcon.RequestOptions.strip_url_path_trailing_slash>` is enabled, routes
should now be added without a trailing slash. Previously, the trailing slash
was always removed as a side effect of a bug regardless of the
:attr:`~falcon.RequestOptions.strip_url_path_trailing_slash` option value.
