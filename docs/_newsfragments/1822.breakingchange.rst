The private attributes for :class:`~.falcon.media.JSONHandler` were renamed, and
the private attributes used by :class:`~.falcon.media.MessagePackHandler` were
replaced. Subclasses that refer to these variables will need to be updated. In
addition, the undocumented :meth:`falcon.media.Handlers.find_by_media_type`
method was deprecated and may be removed in a future release.
