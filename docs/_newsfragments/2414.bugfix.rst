Previously, Falcon's :ref:`WebSocket implementation <ws>` was not documented to
route the request to any :meth:`sink <falcon.asgi.App.add_sink>`. However, in
the case of a missing route, a matching sink was actually invoked, passing
:class:`ws <falcon.asgi.WebSocket>` in place of the incompatible
:class:`resp <falcon.asgi.Response>`.

This mismatch has been addressed by introducing a `ws` keyword argument
(similar to ASGI :meth:`error handlers <falcon.asgi.App.add_error_handler>`)
for sink functions meant to accept WebSocket connections.

For backwards-compatibility, when `ws` is absent from the sink's signature, the
:class:`~falcon.asgi.WebSocket` object is still passed in place of the
incompatible `resp`.
This behavior will change in Falcon 5.0: when draining a WebSocket connection,
`resp` will always be set to ``None``.
