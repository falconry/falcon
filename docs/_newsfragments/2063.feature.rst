A new property, :attr:`~falcon.Request.headers_lower`, was added to provide a unified, self-documenting way to get a copy of all request headers with lower-cased names to facilitate case-insensitive matching for middleware components, etc. that need to be compatible with both WSGI and ASGI. This was done in lieu of introducing a breaking change to the WSGI :attr:`~falcon.Request.headers` property which currently returns uppercased headers from the WSGI environ dictionary.
