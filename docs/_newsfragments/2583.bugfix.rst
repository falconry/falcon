Due to the differences in interpretation of the ASGI specification, Uvicorn
could set `client` in the HTTP connection scope in a way that broke
:meth:`req.access_route <falcon.asgi.Request.access_route>` and
:meth:`req.remote_addr <falcon.asgi.Request.remote_addr>` when the app server
was bound to a Unix domain socket.

This discrepancy was addressed, and Falcon should now fall back to the same
default value (``'127.0.0.1'``) in this case as if `client` was missing
altogether.
