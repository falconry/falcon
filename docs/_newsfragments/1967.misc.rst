The :func:`~falcon.routing.compile_uri_template` utility method has been
deprecated and will be removed in Falcon 4.0. This function was only employed
in the early versions of the framework, and is expected to have been fully
supplanted by the :class:`~falcon.routing.CompiledRouter`. In the unlikely case
it is still in active use, its source code can be simply copied into an
affected application.
