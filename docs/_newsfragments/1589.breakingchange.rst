General refactoring of internal media handler:

*  Deserializing an empty body in handler that do not support them will
   raise :class:`falcon.MediaNotFoundError`, and return a
   ``400 Bad Request`` response. This error may be suppressed by passing
   a default value to ``get_media`` to be used in case of empty body.
   See also :meth:`Request.get_media` for details.
   Previously ``None`` was returned in all cases.
*  Exceptions raised by the handlers are wrapped as
   :class:`falcon.MediaMalformedError`, and return a
   ``400 Bad Request`` response.
*  Subsequent calls to :meth:`Request.get_media` or ``Request.media`` will
   re-raise the same exception, if the fist call ended in an error.
   Previously ``None`` was returned.

External handlers should update their logic to align to the internal falcon handlers.
