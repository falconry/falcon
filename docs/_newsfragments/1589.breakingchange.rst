General refactoring of internal media handler:

*  Deserializing an empty body with an handler that does not support it will
   raise :class:`falcon.MediaNotFoundError`, and return a
   ``400 Bad Request`` response. This error may be suppressed by passing
   a default value to ``get_media`` to be used in case of empty body.
   See also :meth:`Request.get_media` for details.
   Previously ``None`` was returned in all cases without calling the handler.
*  Exceptions raised by the handlers are wrapped as
   :class:`falcon.MediaMalformedError`, and return a
   ``400 Bad Request`` response.
*  Subsequent calls to :meth:`Request.get_media` or :attr:`Request.media` will
   re-raise the same exception, if the fist call ended in an error, unless the
   exception was a :class:`falcon.MediaNotFoundError` and a default value is passed.
   Previously ``None`` was returned.

External handlers should update their logic to align to the internal Falcon handlers.
