Added support for private network requests in :class:`falcon.middleware.CORSMiddleware`.

This feature is disabled by default and can be enabled by passing the ``allow_private_network=True`` keyword argument to :class:`falcon.middleware.CORSMiddleware`.

Two optional parameters were also added:

- ``private_network_access_name``: A human-readable name for the private network resource. This can be displayed in the browser prompt instead of an IP address.
- ``private_network_access_id``: A unique and stable machine-readable identifier, such as a MAC address.
