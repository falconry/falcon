A number of previously deprecated methods, attributes and classes have now been
removed:

* A deprecated utility function, ``falcon.get_http_status()``, was removed.
  Please use :meth:`falcon.code_to_http_status` instead.

* The deprecated ``has_representation()`` method for :class:`~falcon.HTTPError`
  was removed, along with the ``NoRepresentation`` and
  ``OptionalRepresentation`` classes.

* An undocumented, deprecated public method ``find_by_media_type()`` of
  :class:`media.Handlers <falcon.media.Handlers>` was removed.
  Apart from configuring handlers for Internet media types, the rest of
  :class:`~falcon.media.Handlers` is only meant to be used internally by the
  framework (unless documented otherwise).

* Previously, the ``json`` module could be imported via ``falcon.util``.
  This deprecated alias was removed; please import ``json`` directly from the
  :mod:`standard library <json>`, or another third-party JSON library of
  choice.

We decided, on the other hand, to keep the deprecated :class:`falcon.API` alias
until Falcon 5.0.
