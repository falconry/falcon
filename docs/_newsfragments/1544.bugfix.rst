Previously, the default :class:`CompiledRouter <falcon.routing.CompiledRouter>`
was erroneously stripping trailing slashes from URI templates.
This has been fixed so that it is now possible to add two different routes for
a path with and without a trailing forward slash (see also:
:attr:`RequestOptions.strip_url_path_trailing_slash
<falcon.RequestOptions.strip_url_path_trailing_slash>`).
