The class :class:`~.falcon.http_error.OptionalRepresentation` and the attribute
:attr:`~.falcon.HTTPError.has_representation` were removed. The default error
serializer now generates a representation for every error type that derives from
:class:`falcon.HTTPError`. In addition, Falcon now ensures that any previously
set response body is cleared before handling any subclass of
:class:`falcon.HTTPStatus` or any other raised exception.
