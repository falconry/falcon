The class :class:`~.falcon.http_error.OptionalRepresentation` and the attribute
:attr:`~.falcon.HttpError.has_representation` were removed.
Falcon now ensures that the previously set body is cleared before handling a
:class:`~.falcon.HttpStatus` or an exception.
The default error serializer returns a representation every falcon
error that derive from :class:`~.falcon.HttpError`.
