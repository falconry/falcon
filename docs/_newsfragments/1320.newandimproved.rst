The :func:`jsonschema.validate <falcon.media.validators.jsonschema.validate>`
decorator now raises an instance of :class:`~falcon.MediaValidationError`
instead of the generic :class:`~falcon.HTTPBadRequest` for request media
validation failures. Although the default behavior is kept unaltered in a
backwards-compatible fashion (as the specialized exception subclasses the
generic one), but it can now be easily customized by adding an error handler
for the new class.
