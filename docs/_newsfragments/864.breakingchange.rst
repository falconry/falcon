Falcon is no longer vendoring the
`python-mimeparse <https://github.com/falconry/python-mimeparse>`_ library;
the relevant functionality has instead been reimplemented in the framework
itself, fixing a handful of long-standing bugs in the new implementation.

The following new behaviors are considered breaking changes:

* Previously, the iterable passed to
  :meth:`req.client_prefers <falcon.Request.client_prefers>` had to be sorted in
  the order of increasing desirability.
  :func:`~falcon.mediatypes.best_match`, and by proxy
  :meth:`~falcon.Request.client_prefers`, now consider the provided media types
  to be sorted in the (more intuitive, we hope) order of decreasing
  desirability.

* Unlike ``python-mimeparse``, the new
  :ref:`media type utilities <mediatype_util>` consider media types with
  different values for the same parameters as non-matching.

The new functions,
:func:`falcon.mediatypes.quality` and :func:`falcon.mediatypes.best_match`,
otherwise have the same signature as the corresponding methods from
``python-mimeparse``.
