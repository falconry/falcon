When a request was streamed using the chunked transfer encoding (with no
``Content-Length`` known in advance), iterating over
:attr:`req.stream <falcon.asgi.Request.stream>` could hang until the client had
disconnected. This bug has been fixed, and iteration now stops upon receiving
the last body chunk as expected.
