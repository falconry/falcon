ASGI+HTTP support was added to the framework via a new class, :class:`falcon.asgi.App`. The
:ref:`testing <testing>` module was also updated to fully support ASGI apps, including two
new helper functions: :func:`falcon.testing.create_scope` and
:func:`falcon.testing.create_asgi_req`. WSGI users also get a new
:func:`falcon.testing.create_req` method.
