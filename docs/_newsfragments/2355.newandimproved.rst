Added a new flag :attr:`~falcon.ResponseOptions.xml_error_serialization` that
can be used to disable XML serialization of :class:`~falcon.HTTPError` when
using the default error serializer (and the client preferred it).
This flag currently defaults to ``True``, keeping the same behavior as the previous
Falcon series; Falcon 5.0 will change the default to ``False``, with the objective of
completely removing support for it in a future version.
User that whish to retain support for XML serialization of the errors in the default
error serializer should add an XML media handler.

Deprecated the :meth:`~falcon.HTTPError.to_xml` method.
