A new flag, :attr:`~falcon.ResponseOptions.xml_error_serialization`, has been
added to :attr:`~falcon.ResponseOptions` that can be used to disable automatic
XML serialization of :class:`~falcon.HTTPError` when using the default error
serializer (and the client prefers it).

This new flag currently defaults to ``True``, preserving the same behavior as
the previous Falcon versions. Falcon 5.0 will either change the default to
``False``, or remove the automatic XML error serialization altogether.
If you wish to retain support for XML serialization in the default error
serializer, you should add a
:ref:`response media handler for XML <custom_media_handlers>`.

In accordance with this change, the :meth:`falcon.HTTPError.to_xml` method was
deprecated.
