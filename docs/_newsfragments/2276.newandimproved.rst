The class :class:`~falcon.HTTPPayloadTooLarge` was renamed to
:class:`~falcon.HTTPContentTooLarge`, together with the accompanying HTTP
:ref:`status code <status>` updates, in order to reflect the newest HTTP
semantics as per RFC 9110, Section 15.5.14.
(The old class name remains available as a deprecated compatibility alias.)
