:ref:`WebSocket <ws>` implementation has been fixed to properly handle
:class:`~falcon.HTTPError` and :class:`~falcon.HTTPStatus` exceptions raised by
custom :func:`error handlers <falcon.asgi.App.add_error_handler>`.
The WebSocket connection is now correctly closed with an appropriate code
instead of bubbling up an unhandled error to the application server.
