Falcon will now raise an instance of
:class:`~falcon.errors.WebSocketDisconnected` from the :class:`OSError` that
the ASGI server signals in the case of a disconnected client as per
the `ASGI HTTP & WebSocket protocol
<https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/specs/www.html#id2>`__ version ``2.4``.
It is worth noting though that Falcon's
:ref:`built-in receive buffer <ws_lost_connection>` normally detects the
``websocket.disconnect`` event itself prior the potentially failing attempt to
``send()``.
