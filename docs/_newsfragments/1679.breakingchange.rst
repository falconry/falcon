The :attr:`falcon.Response.data` property now just simply returns the same data
object that it was set to, if any, rather than also checking and serializing
the value of the :attr:`falcon.Response.media` property. Instead, a new
:meth:`~falcon.Response.render_body` method has been implemented, which can be
used to obtain the HTTP response body for the request, taking into account
the :attr:`~falcon.Response.text`, :attr:`~falcon.Response.data`, and
:attr:`~falcon.Response.media` attributes.
