Static routes now support ``Range`` requests. This is useful for streaming
media or resumable downloads.

The ``Request.range`` property now has stricter validation:
   * when parsing a byte-range-spec with a last-byte-pos, it must be greater
     than or equal to first-byte-pos, and
   * when parsing a suffix-byte-range-spec, suffix-length must be positive.
