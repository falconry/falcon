The :attr:`Request.range <falcon.Request.range>` property now has stricter
validation:

  * When parsing a byte-range-spec with a last-byte-pos, it must be greater
    than or equal to first-byte-pos.
  * When parsing a suffix-byte-range-spec, suffix-length must be positive.

:func:`Static routes <falcon.App.add_static_route>` now support ``Range``
requests. This is useful for streaming media and resumable downloads.
