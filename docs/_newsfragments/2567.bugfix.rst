Falcon's documentation build process was not fully reproducible, as the output
could vary with the build system's date. The issue was addressed by adding
support for setting the build date via the
`SOURCE_DATE_EPOCH <https://reproducible-builds.org/docs/source-date-epoch/>`__
standardized environment variable.
