:class:`~falcon.testing.TestCase` mimics behavior of real WSGI servers following WSGI spec where is said that ``PATH_INFO`` CGI variable for WSGI app is already percent-decoded. However, this breaks routing if slash (encoded as ``%2F``) is part of path element, not a path separator, as explained in the FAQ :ref:`routing_encoded_slashes`. The workaround based on some WSGI servers' non-standard CGI variables described in :ref:`raw_url_path_recipe` recipe breaks tests because :py:func:`falcon.testing.helpers.create_environ` hard-code CGI variable ``RAW_URI`` to ``/`` instead to real path *before* percent-decoding.
