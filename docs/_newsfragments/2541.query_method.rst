QUERY method
------------

Falcon now supports a retrieval-like HTTP method named ``QUERY``. It is
treated as a safe, idempotent method for routing while still permitting an
optional request body. Resources can implement an ``on_query(self, req, resp,
...)`` responder to handle this method the same way they implement other
responders (for example, ``on_get``).

See also the evolving discussion around safe methods with bodies (OpenAPI
3.2 and the IETF draft "HTTP Methods with Body").
