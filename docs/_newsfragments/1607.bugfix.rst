Previously, response serialization errors (such as in the case of a faulty
custom media handler, or because an instance of
:class:`~falcon.HTTPUnsupportedMediaType` was raised for an unsupported
response content type) were unexpectedly bubbled up to the application server.
This has been fixed, and these errors are now handled exactly the same way as
other exceptions raised in a responder (see also: :ref:`errors`).
