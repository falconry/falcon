The Falcon Web Framework
=================================

Release v\ |version| (:ref:`Installation <install>`)

Falcon is a minimalist WSGI library for building speedy web APIs and app
backends. We like to think of Falcon as the `Dieter Rams` of web frameworks.

When it comes to building HTTP APIs, other frameworks weigh you down with tons
of dependencies and unnecessary abstractions. Falcon cuts to the chase with a
clean design that embraces HTTP and the REST architectural style.

.. code:: python

    class CatalogItem(object):

        # ...

        @falcon.before(hooks.to_oid)
        def on_get(self, id):
            return self._collection.find_one(id)

    app = falcon.API(after=[hooks.serialize])
    app.add_route('/items/{id}', CatalogItem())

What People are Saying
----------------------

"We have been using Falcon as a replacement for [framework] and we simply love the performance (three times faster) and code base size (easily half of our original [framework] code)."

"Falcon looks great so far. I hacked together a quick test for a
tiny server of mine and was ~40% faster with only 20 minutes of
work."

"Falcon is rock solid and it's fast."

"I'm loving #falconframework! Super clean and simple, I finally
have the speed and flexibility I need!"

"I feel like I'm just talking HTTP at last, with nothing in the
middle. Falcon seems like the requests of backend."

"The source code for Falcon is so good, I almost prefer it to
documentation. It basically can't be wrong."

"What other framework has integrated support for 786 TRY IT NOW ?"
