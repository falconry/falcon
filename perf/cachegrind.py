-------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Proof-of-concept: run a program under Cachegrind, combining all the various
metrics into one single performance metric.

Requires Python 3.

License: https://opensource.org/licenses/MIT


## Features

* Disables ASLR.
* Sets consistent cache sizes.
* Calculates a combined performance metric.

For more information see the detailed write up at:

https://pythonspeed.com/articles/consistent-benchmarking-in-ci/

## Usage

This script has no compatibility guarnatees, I recommend copying it into your
repository. To use:

$ python3 cachegrind.py ./yourprogram --yourparam=yourvalues

The last line printed will be a combined performance metric.
