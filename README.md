Falcon [![Build Status](https://travis-ci.org/racker/falcon.png)](https://travis-ci.org/racker/falcon)
======

:runner: Come hang out with us in **#falconframework** on freenode.

Falcon is a [high-performance Python framework][home] for building cloud APIs. It tries to do as little as possible while remaining [highly effective][benefits].

### Design Goals ###

**Fast.** Cloud APIs need to turn around requests quickly, and make efficient use of hardware. This is particularly important when serving many concurrent requests. Falcon processes requests [several times faster][bench] than other popular web frameworks.

**Light.** Only the essentials are included, with *six* being the only dependency outside the standard library. We work to keep the code lean, making Falcon easier to test, optimize, and deploy.

**Flexible.** Falcon can be deployed in a variety of ways, depending on your needs. The framework speaks WSGI, and works great with [Python 2.6 and 2.7, PyPy, and Python 3.3][ci]. There's no tight coupling with any async framework, leaving you free to mix-and-match what you need.

### Features ###

* Intuitive routing via URI templates and resource classes
* Easy access to headers and bodies through request and response classes
* Idiomatic HTTP error responses via a handy exception base class
* DRY request processing using global, resource, and method hooks
* Snappy unit testing through WSGI helpers and mocks
* 20% speed boost when Cython is available
* Python 2.6, Python 2.7, PyPy and Python 3.3 support
* Speed, speed, and more speed!

### Install ###

```bash
$ pip install cython falcon
```

### Test ###

```bash
$ pip install nose && nosetests
```

To test across all supported Python versions:

```bash
$ pip install tox && tox
```

### Usage ###

Read the source, Luke!

Docstrings can be found throughout the Falcon code base for your learning pleasure. You can also ask questions in **#falconframework** on freenode. We are planning on having real docs eventually; if you need them right away, consider sending a pull request. ;)

Here is a simple example showing how to create a Falcon-based API.

```python
class ThingsResource:
    def on_get(self, req, resp):
        """Handles GET requests"""
        resp.status = falcon.HTTP_200
        resp.body = 'Hello world!'

# falcon.API instances are callable WSGI apps
wsgi_app = api = falcon.API()

# Resources are represented by long-lived class instances
things = ThingsResource()

# things will handle all requests to the '/things' URL path
api.add_route('/things', things)
```

Here is a more involved example, demonstrating getting headers and query parameters, handling errors, and reading/writing message bodies.

```python

import json
import logging

import falcon


class StorageEngine:
    pass


class StorageError(Exception):
    pass


def token_is_valid(token, user_id):
    return True  # Suuuuuure it's valid...


def auth(req, resp, params):
    # Alternatively, do this in middleware
    token = req.get_header('X-Auth-Token')

    if token is None:
        raise falcon.HTTPUnauthorized('Auth token required',
                                      'Please provide an auth token '
                                      'as part of the request',
                                      'http://docs.example.com/auth')

    if not token_is_valid(token, params['user_id']):
        raise falcon.HTTPUnauthorized('Authentication required',
                                      'The provided auth token is '
                                      'not valid. Please request a '
                                      'new token and try again.',
                                      'http://docs.example.com/auth')


def check_media_type(req, resp, params):
    if not req.client_accepts_json():
        raise falcon.HTTPUnsupportedMediaType(
            'Media Type not Supported',
            'This API only supports the JSON media type.',
            'http://docs.examples.com/api/json')

    def __init__(self, db):
        self.db = db
        self.logger = logging.getLogger('thingsapi.' + __name__)

        marker = req.get_param('marker', default='')
        limit = req.get_param_as_int('limit', default=50)

        try:
            result = self.db.get_things(marker, limit)
        except Exception as ex:

            description = ('Aliens have attacked our base! We will '
                           'be back as soon as we fight them off. '
                           'We appreciate your patience.')

            raise falcon.HTTPServiceUnavailable('Service Outage', description)

        resp.set_header('X-Powered-By', 'Donuts')

                                   'Malformed JSON',
                                   'Could not decode the request body. The '
                                   'JSON was incorrect.')

        try:
            proper_thing = self.db.add_thing(thing)

        except StorageError:
            raise falcon.HTTPError(falcon.HTTP_725,
                                   'Database Error',
                                   "Sorry, couldn't write your thing to the "
                                   'database. It worked on my machine.')

        resp.location = '/%s/things/%s' % (user_id, proper_thing.id)

wsgi_app = api = falcon.API(before=[auth, check_media_type])

db = StorageEngine()
things = ThingsResource(db)
api.add_route('/{user_id}/things', things)
