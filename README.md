**[Experimental]**

Falcon is a swift, light-weight framework for building cloud APIs. It focuses on doing one thing (web APIs), and doing it right. Falcon's design philosophy is borrowed from a passage in Antoine de Saint-Exupéry's book, *Wind, Sand, and Stars*:

>Perfection is finally attained not when there is no longer anything to add, but when there is no longer anything to take away.

### Design ###

**Light-weight.** Only the essentials are included, with few dependencies. We work to keep the code lean-n-mean, making Falcon easier to test, optimize, and deploy. 

**Surprisingly agile.** Although light-weight, Falcon is surprisingly effective. Getting started with the framework is easy. Common web API idioms are supported out of the box without getting in your way. This is a framework designed for journeyman web developers and master craftsman alike.

**Cloud-friendly.** Falcon uses the web-friendly Python language, and speaks WSGI, so you can deploy it on your favorite stack. The framework is designed from the ground up to embrace HTTP, not work against it. Plus, diagnostics are built right in to make it easier to track down sneaky bugs and frustrating performance problems.
