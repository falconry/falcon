## Contributing

Kurt Griffiths (kgriffs) is the creator and current maintainer of the Falcon framework. Pull requests are always welcome.

Before submitting a pull request, please ensure you have added or updated tests as appropriate, and that all existing tests still pass with your changes on both Python 2 and Python 3. Please also ensure that your coding style follows PEP 8 and doesn't cause pyflakes to complain. 

You can check all this by running the following from within the falcon project directory (requires Python 2.7 and Python 3.3 to be installed on your system):

```bash
$ tox -e py27,py33,pep8
```

### Code style rules

* Docstrings are required for classes, attributes, methods, and functions.
* Docstrings should utilize the [napolean style][docstrings] in order to make them read well, regardless of whether they are viewed through `help()` or on [Read the Docs][rtd].
* Format non-trivial comments using your GitHub nick and one of these prefixes:
    * TODO(riker): Damage report!
    * NOTE(riker): Well, that's certainly good to know.
    * PERF(riker): Travel time to the nearest starbase?
    * APPSEC(riker): In all trust, there is the possibility for betrayal.
* When catching exceptions, name the variable `ex`.
* Use whitespace to separate logical blocks of code and to improve readability.
* No single-character variable names except for trivial indexes when looping,
or in mathematical expressions implementing well-known formulas.
* Heavily document code that is especially complex and/or clever.
* When in doubt, optimize for readability.

### Commit Message Format

Falcon's commit message format uses [AngularJS's style guide][ajs], reproduced here for convenience, with some minor edits for clarity.

Each commit message consists of a **header**, a **body** and a **footer**. The header has a special format that includes a **type**, a **scope** and a **subject**:

```
<type>(<scope>): <subject>
<BLANK LINE>
<body>
<BLANK LINE>
<footer>
```

No line may exceed 100 characters. This makes it easier to read the message on GitHub as well as in various git tools.

#####  Type
Must be one of the following:

* **feat**: A new feature
* **fix**: A bug fix
* **docs**: Documentation only changes
* **style**: Changes that do not affect the meaning of the code (white-space, formatting, missing semi-colons, etc)
* **refactor**: A code change that neither fixes a bug or adds a feature
* **perf**: A code change that improves performance
* **test**: Adding missing tests
* **chore**: Changes to the build process or auxiliary tools and libraries such as documentation generation
 
##### Scope
The scope could be anything specifying place of the commit change. For example: `$location`, `$browser`, `$compile`, `$rootScope`, `ngHref`, `ngClick`, `ngView`, etc...

##### Subject
The subject contains succinct description of the change:

* use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"
* don't capitalize first letter
* no dot (.) at the end

##### Body
Just as in the **subject**, use the imperative, present tense: "change" not "changed" nor "changes"The body should include the motivation for the change and contrast this with previous behavior.

##### Footer
The footer should contain any information about **Breaking Changes** and is also the place to reference GitHub issues that this commit **Closes**.
