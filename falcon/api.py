class API(object):
    """This class is the main entry point into a Falcon-based app.

    Each API instance provides a callable WSGI interface and a routing
    engine.

    Keyword Arguments:
        media_type (str): Default media type to use as the
            value for the Content-Type header on responses (default
            'application/json'). The ``falcon`` module provides a
            number of constants for common media types, such as
            ``falcon.MEDIA_MSGPACK``, ``falcon.MEDIA_YAML``,
            ``falcon.MEDIA_XML``, etc.
        middleware(object or list): Either a single object or a list
            of objects (instantiated classes) that implement the
            following middleware component interface::

                class ExampleComponent(object):

                        Args:
                            req: Request object that will eventually be
                                routed to an on_* responder method.
                            resp: Response object that will be routed to
                                the on_* responder.

                            This method is only called when the request matches
                            a route to a resource.

                            resp: Response object that will be passed to the
                                responder.
                            resource: Resource object to which the request was

                                the request.
                            params: A dict-like object representing any
                                additional params derived from the route's URI

        request_type (Request): ``Request``-like class to use instead
            of Falcon's default class. Among other things, this feature
            affords inheriting from ``falcon.request.Request`` in order
            to override the ``context_type`` class variable.

        response_type (Response): ``Response``-like class to use

        router (object): An instance of a custom router
            to use in lieu of the default engine.
            (See also: :ref:`Custom Routers <routing_custom>`)

        independent_middleware (bool): Set to ``False`` if response
            middleware should not be executed independently of whether or
            not request middleware raises an exception (default
            ``True``). When this option is set to ``False``, a middleware
            component's ``process_response()`` method will NOT be called
            when that same component's ``process_request()`` (or that of
            a component higher up in the stack) raises an exception.

    Attributes:
        req_options: A set of behavioral options related to incoming
            requests. (See also: :py:class:`~.RequestOptions`)
        resp_options: A set of behavioral options related to outgoing
            responses. (See also: :py:class:`~.ResponseOptions`)
        router_options: Configuration options for the router. If a

        """Associate a templatized URI path with a resource.

        Falcon routes incoming requests to resources based on a set of
        URI templates. If the path requested by the client matches the
        template for a given route, the request is then passed on to the
        associated resource for processing.

        If no route matches the request, control then passes to a
        default responder that simply raises an instance of
        :class:`~.HTTPNotFound`.

        This method delegates to the configured router's ``add_route()``
        method. To override the default behavior, pass a custom router
        object to the :class:`~.API` initializer.

        Args:
            uri_template (str): A templatized URI. Care must be
                taken to ensure the template does not mask any sink
                patterns, if any are registered.

                (See also: :meth:`~.add_sink`)

            resource (instance): Object which represents a REST
                resource. Falcon will pass GET requests to ``on_get()``,
                PUT requests to ``on_put()``, etc. If any HTTP methods are not
                supported by your resource, simply don't define the
                corresponding request handlers, and Falcon will do the right
                thing.

        Keyword Args:
            suffix (str): Optional responder name suffix for this route. If
                a suffix is provided, Falcon will map GET requests to
                ``on_get_{suffix}()``, POST requests to ``on_post_{suffix}()``,
                etc. In this way, multiple closely-related routes can be
                mapped to the same resource. For example, a single resource
                class can use suffixed responders to distinguish requests
                for a single item vs. a collection of those same items.
                Another class might use a suffixed responder to handle
                a shortlink route in addition to the regular route for the
                resource.

        Note:
            Any additional keyword arguments not defined above are passed
            through to the underlying router's ``add_route()`` method. The
            default router ignores any additional keyword arguments, but
            custom routers may take advantage of this feature to receive
            additional options when setting up routes. Custom routers MUST
            accept such arguments using the variadic pattern (``**kwargs``), and
            ignore any keyword arguments that they don't support.

        Static routes provide a way to serve files directly. This
        feature provides an alternative to serving files at the web server
        level when you don't have that option, when authorization is
        required, or for testing purposes.

        Warning:
            Serving files directly from the web server,
            rather than through the Python app, will always be more efficient,
            and therefore should be preferred in production deployments.
            For security reasons, the directory and the fallback_filename (if provided)
            should be read only for the account running the application.

        Static routes are matched in LIFO order. Therefore, if the same
        prefix is used for two routes, the second one will override the
        first. This also means that more specific routes should be added
        *after* less specific ones. For example, the following sequence
        would result in ``'/foo/bar/thing.js'`` being mapped to the
        ``'/foo/bar'`` route, and ``'/foo/xyz/thing.js'`` being mapped to the
        ``'/foo'`` route::

            prefix (str): The path prefix to match for this route. If the
                path in the requested URI starts with this string, the remainder
                of the path will be appended to the source directory to
                determine the file to serve. This is done in a secure manner
                to prevent an attacker from requesting a file outside the
                specified directory.

                Note that static routes are matched in LIFO order, and are only
                attempted after checking dynamic routes and sinks.

            directory (str): The source directory from which to serve files.
            downloadable (bool): Set to ``True`` to include a
                Content-Disposition header in the response. The "filename"

        Error handlers may be registered for any type, including
        :class:`~.HTTPError`. This feature provides a central location
        for logging and otherwise handling exceptions raised by
        responders, hooks, and middleware components.

        A handler can raise an instance of :class:`~.HTTPError` or
        :class:`~.HTTPStatus` to communicate information about the issue to
        the client.  Alternatively, a handler may modify `resp`
        directly.

        Error handlers are matched in LIFO order. In other words, when
        searching for an error handler to match a raised exception, and
        more than one handler matches the exception type, the framework
        will choose the one that was most recently registered.
        Therefore, more general error handlers (e.g., for the
        standard ``Exception`` type) should be added first, to avoid
        masking more specific handlers for subclassed types.

        Args:
            exception (type): Whenever an error occurs when handling a request
                that is an instance of this exception class, the associated
                handler will be called.
            handler (callable): A function or callable object taking the form
                ``func(req, resp, ex, params)``.

                If not specified explicitly, the handler will default to
                ``exception.handle``, where ``exception`` is the error
                type specified above, and ``handle`` is a static method
                (i.e., decorated with @staticmethod) that accepts
                the same params just described. For example::

        Note:
