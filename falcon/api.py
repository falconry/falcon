    def add_route(self, uri_template, resource):
        """Associate a URI path with a resource

        A resource is an instance of a class that defines various on_*
        "responder" methods, one for each HTTP method the resource
        allows. For example, to support GET, simply define an "on_get"
        responder. If a client requests an unsupported method, Falcon
        will respond with "405 Method not allowed".

        Responders must always define at least two arguments to receive
        request and response objects, respectively. For example:

            def on_post(self, req, resp):
                pass

        In addition, if the route's uri template contains field
        expressions, any responders that desires to receive requests
        for that route must accept arguments named after the respective
        field names defined in the template. For example, given the
        following uri template:

            /das/{thing}

        A PUT request to "/das/code" would be routed to:

            def on_put(self, req, resp, thing):
                pass

        If, on the other hand, the responder had been defined thus:

            def on_put(self, req, resp):
                pass

        Falcon would respond to the client's request with "405 Method
        not allowed." This allows you to define multiple routes to the
        same resource, e.g., in order to support GET for "/widget/1234"
        and POST to "/widgets". In this last example, a POST to
        "/widget/5000" would result in a 405 response.

        Args:
            uri_template: Relative URI template. Currently only Level 1
                templates are supported. See also RFC 6570.
            resource: Object which represents an HTTP/REST "resource". Falcon
                will pass "GET" requests to on_get, "PUT" requests to on_put,
                etc. If any HTTP methods are not supported by your resource,
                simply don't define the corresponding request handlers, and
                Falcon will do the right thing.
