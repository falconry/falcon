        A resource is an instance of a class that defines various

        allows. Responder names start with `on_` and are named according to
        which HTTP method they handle, as in `on_get`, `on_post`, `on_put`,
        etc.

        If your resource does not support a particular
        HTTP method, simply omit the corresponding responder and
        Falcon will reply with "405 Method not allowed" if that
        method is ever requested.

        Responders must always define at least two arguments to receive
        request and response objects, respectively. For example::

            def on_post(self, req, resp):
                pass

        In addition, if the route's template contains field
        expressions, any responder that desires to receive requests
        for that route must accept arguments named after the respective
        field names defined in the template. A field expression consists
        of a bracketed field name.

        For example, given the following template::

            /user/{name}

        A PUT request to "/user/kgriffs" would be routed to::

            def on_put(self, req, resp, name):
                pass

        Individual path segments may contain one or more field expressions.

                resource. Falcon will pass "GET" requests to on_get,

                supported by your resource, simply don't define the
