    Each API instance provides a callable WSGI interface and a simple routing

            the Content-Type header on responses. (default 'application/json')
        before (callable, optional): A global action hook (or list of hooks)
            to call before each on_* responder, for all resources. Similar to
            the ``falcon.before`` decorator, but applies to the entire API.
            When more than one hook is given, they will be executed
            in natural order (starting with the first in the list).
        after (callable, optional): A global action hook (or list of hooks)
            to call after each on_* responder, for all resources. Similar to
            the ``after`` decorator, but applies to the entire API.
        request_type (Request, optional): Request-alike class to use instead
            of Falcon's default class. Useful if you wish to extend
            ``falcon.request.Request`` with a custom ``context_type``.
            (default falcon.request.Request)
        response_type (Response, optional): Response-alike class to use

        A resource is an instance of a class that defines various on_*

        allows. For example, to support GET, simply define an `on_get`
        responder. If a client requests an unsupported method, Falcon
        will respond with "405 Method not allowed".

        Responders must always define at least two arguments to receive
        request and response objects, respectively. For example::

            def on_post(self, req, resp):
                pass

        In addition, if the route's uri template contains field
        expressions, any responder that desires to receive requests
        for that route must accept arguments named after the respective
        field names defined in the template. For example, given the
        following uri template::

            /das/{thing}

                patterns (see also ``add_sink``).
            resource (instance): Object which represents an HTTP/REST
                "resource". Falcon will pass "GET" requests to on_get,
                "PUT" requests to on_put, etc. If any HTTP methods are not
                supported by your resource, simply don't define the
                corresponding request handlers, and Falcon will do the right
