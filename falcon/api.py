class API(object):
    """This class is the main entry point into a Falcon-based app.

    Each API instance provides a callable WSGI interface and a simple routing
    engine based on URI Templates (RFC 6570).

    Args:
        media_type (str, optional): Default media type to use as the value for
            the Content-Type header on responses. (default 'application/json')
        before (callable, optional): A global action hook (or list of hooks)
            to call before each on_* responder, for all resources. Similar to
            the ``falcon.before`` decorator, but applies to the entire API.
            When more than one hook is given, they will be executed
            in natural order (starting with the first in the list).
        after (callable, optional): A global action hook (or list of hooks)
            to call after each on_* responder, for all resources. Similar to
            the ``after`` decorator, but applies to the entire API.
        middleware(callable class, optional): A global action middleware (or
            list of middlewares) to be executed wrapping the responder.
            Middleware object can define process_request and process_response,
            and they will be executed in natural order, as if they were round
            layers over responder:
                process_request is executed in the same order of definition
                process_response and process_exception in reversed order
            if you define middleware=[OutSideMw, InsideMw]
            the order will be:
                OutsideMw.process_request
                    InsideMw.process_request
                        responder
                    InsideMw.process_response
                OutsideMw.process_request
            Any exception would apply process_response of the unexecuted mw.
        request_type (Request, optional): Request-alike class to use instead
            of Falcon's default class. Useful if you wish to extend
            ``falcon.request.Request`` with a custom ``context_type``.
            (default falcon.request.Request)
        response_type (Response, optional): Response-alike class to use
            instead of Falcon's default class. (default

        responder. If a client requests an unsupported method, Falcon
        will respond with "405 Method not allowed".

        Responders must always define at least two arguments to receive
        request and response objects, respectively. For example::

            def on_post(self, req, resp):

                "resource". Falcon will pass "GET" requests to on_get,
                "PUT" requests to on_put, etc. If any HTTP methods are not
                supported by your resource, simply don't define the
