        Note:
            The following information describes the behavior of
            Falcon's default router.

        A resource is an instance of a class that defines various
        "responder" methods, one for each HTTP method the resource
        allows. Responder names start with `on_` and are named according to
        which HTTP method they handle, as in `on_get`, `on_post`, `on_put`,
        etc.

        Note:
            If your resource does not support a particular
            HTTP method, simply omit the corresponding responder and
            Falcon will reply with "405 Method not allowed" if that
            method is ever requested.

        Responders must always define at least two arguments to receive
        :class:`~.Request` and :class:`~.Response` objects, respectively.
        For example::

            def on_post(self, req, resp):
                pass

        The :class:`~.Request` object represents the incoming HTTP
        request. It exposes properties and methods for examining headers,
        query string parameters, and other metadata associated with
        the request. A file-like stream is also provided for reading
        any data that was included in the body of the request.

        The :class:`~.Response` object represents the application's
        HTTP response to the above request. It provides properties
        and methods for setting status, header and body data. The
        :class:`~.Response` object also exposes a dict-like
        :attr:`~.Response.context` property for passing arbitrary
        data to hooks and middleware methods. This property could be
        used, for example, to provide a resource representation to a
        middleware component that would then serialize the
        representation according to the client's preferred media type.

        Note:
            Rather than directly manipulate the :class:`~.Response`
            object, a responder may raise an instance of either
            :class:`~.HTTPError` or :class:`~.HTTPStatus`.

        In addition to the standard `req` and `resp` parameters, if the
        route's template contains field expressions, any responder that
        desires to receive requests for that route must accept arguments
        named after the respective field names defined in the template.

        A field expression consists of a bracketed field name. For
        example, given the following template::

            /user/{name}

        A PUT request to "/user/kgriffs" would be routed to::

            def on_put(self, req, resp, name):
                pass

        Individual path segments may contain one or more field
        expressions, and fields need not span the entire path
        segment. For example::

            /repos/{org}/{repo}/compare/{usr0}:{branch0}...{usr1}:{branch1}
            /serviceRoot/People('{name}')

        Note:
            Because field names correspond to argument names in responder
            methods, they must be valid Python identifiers.

        Args:
            uri_template (str): A templatized URI. Care must be
                taken to ensure the template does not mask any sink
                patterns, if any are registered (see also `add_sink`).
            resource (instance): Object which represents a REST
                resource. Falcon will pass "GET" requests to on_get,
                "PUT" requests to on_put, etc. If any HTTP methods are not
                supported by your resource, simply don't define the
                corresponding request handlers, and Falcon will do the right
                thing.

        Note:
            Any additional args and kwargs not defined above are passed
            through to the underlying router's ``add_route()`` method. The
            default router does not expect any additional arguments, but
            custom routers may take advantage of this feature to receive
            additional options when setting up routes.

        Using sinks, you can drain and dynamically handle a large number
        of routes, when creating static resources and responders would be
        impractical. For example, you might use a sink to create a smart

                may be specified. Characters are matched starting at the

        the client.  Alternatively, a handler may modify `resp`
        directly.

        Error handlers are matched in LIFO order. In other words, when
        searching for an error handler to match a raised exception, and
        more than one handler matches the exception type, the framework
        will choose the one that was most recently registered.
        Therefore, more general error handlers (e.g., for the
        standard ``Exception`` type) should be added first, to avoid
        masking more specific handlers for subclassed types.

        Args:
            exception (type): Whenever an error occurs when handling a request
                that is an instance of this exception class, the associated
                handler will be called.
            handler (callable): A function or callable object taking the form
                ``func(ex, req, resp, params)``.

                If not specified explicitly, the handler will default to
                ``exception.handle``, where ``exception`` is the error
                type specified above, and ``handle`` is a static method
                (i.e., decorated with @staticmethod) that accepts
                the same params just described. For example::

                    class CustomException(CustomBaseException):

                        @staticmethod
                        def handle(ex, req, resp, params):

        When a responder raises an instance of :class:`~.HTTPError`,

        default serializer supports JSON and XML, but may be overridden
        by this method to use a custom serializer in order to support
        other media types.

        Note:
            If a custom media type is used and the type includes a
            "+json" or "+xml" suffix, the default serializer will
            convert the error to JSON or XML, respectively.

        The :class:`~.HTTPError` class contains helper methods,
        such as `to_json()` and `to_dict()`, that can be used from
