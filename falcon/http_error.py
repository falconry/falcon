class HTTPError(Exception):
    """Represents a generic HTTP error.

    Raise this or a child class to have Falcon automagically return pretty
    error responses (with an appropriate HTTP status code) to the client
    when something goes wrong.

    Attributes:
        status (str): HTTP status line, such as "748 Confounded by Ponies".
        has_representation (bool): Read-only property that determines
            whether error details will be serialized when composing
            the HTTP response. In ``HTTPError`` this property always
            returns ``True``, but child classes may override it
            in order to return ``False`` when an empty HTTP body is desired.
            See also the ``falcon.http_error.NoRepresentation`` mixin.
        title (str): Error title to send to the client. Will be ``None`` if
            the error should result in an HTTP response with an empty body.
        description (str): Description of the error to send to the client.
        headers (dict): Extra headers to add to the response.
        link (str): An href that the client can provide to the user for
            getting help.
        code (int): An internal application code that a user can reference when
            requesting support for the error.

    Args:
        status (str): HTTP status code and text, such as "400 Bad Request"

    Keyword Args:
        title (str): Human-friendly error title (default ``None``).
        description (str): Human-friendly description of the error, along with
            a helpful suggestion or two (default ``None``).
        headers (dict or list): A dictionary of header names and values
            to set, or list of (name, value) tuples. Both names and
            values must be of type str or StringType, and only character
            values 0x00 through 0xFF may be used on platforms that use
            wide characters.

            Note:
                The Content-Type header, if present, will be overriden. If
                you wish to return custom error messages, you can create
                your own HTTP error class, and install an error handler
                to convert it into an appropriate HTTP response for the
                client

            Note:
                Falcon can process a list of tuples slightly faster
                than a dict.

        headers (dict): Extra headers to return in the
            response to the client (default ``None``).
        href (str): A URL someone can visit to find out more information
            (default ``None``). Unicode characters are percent-encoded.
        href_text (str): If href is given, use this as the friendly
            title/description for the link (defaults to "API documentation
            for this error").
        code (int): An internal code that customers can reference in their
            support request or to help them when searching for knowledge
            base articles related to this error (default ``None``).
