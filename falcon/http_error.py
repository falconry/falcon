class HTTPError(Exception):
    """Represents a generic HTTP error.

    Raise an instance or subclass of ``HTTPError`` to have Falcon return
    a formatted error response and an appropriate HTTP status code
    to the client when something goes wrong. JSON and XML media types
    are supported by default.

    To customize the error presentation, implement a custom error
    serializer and set it on the :class:`~.API` instance via
    :meth:`~.API.set_error_serializer`.

    To customize what data is passed to the serializer, subclass
    ``HTTPError`` and override the ``to_dict()`` method (``to_json()``
    is implemented via ``to_dict()``). To also support XML, override
    the ``to_xml()`` method.

    Attributes:
        status (str): HTTP status line, e.g. '748 Confounded by Ponies'.
        has_representation (bool): Read-only property that determines
            whether error details will be serialized when composing
            the HTTP response. In ``HTTPError`` this property always
            returns ``True``, but child classes may override it
            in order to return ``False`` when an empty HTTP body is desired.
            See also the ``falcon.http_error.NoRepresentation`` mixin.
        title (str): Error title to send to the client.
        description (str): Description of the error to send to the client.
        headers (dict): Extra headers to add to the response.
        link (str): An href that the client can provide to the user for
            getting help.
        code (int): An internal application code that a user can reference when
            requesting support for the error.

    Args:
        status (str): HTTP status code and text, such as "400 Bad Request"

    Keyword Args:
        title (str): Human-friendly error title. If not provided, defaults
            to the HTTP status line as determined by the ``status`` argument.
        description (str): Human-friendly description of the error, along with
            a helpful suggestion or two (default ``None``).
        headers (dict or list): A ``dict`` of header names and values
            to set, or a ``list`` of (*name*, *value*) tuples. Both *name* and
            *value* must be of type ``str`` or ``StringType``, and only
            character values 0x00 through 0xFF may be used on platforms that
            use wide characters.

            Note:
                The Content-Type header, if present, will be overridden. If
                you wish to return custom error messages, you can create
                your own HTTP error class, and install an error handler
                to convert it into an appropriate HTTP response for the
                client

            Note:
                Falcon can process a list of ``tuple`` slightly faster
                than a ``dict``.

        headers (dict): Extra headers to return in the
            response to the client (default ``None``).
        href (str): A URL someone can visit to find out more information
            (default ``None``). Unicode characters are percent-encoded.
        href_text (str): If href is given, use this as the friendly
            title/description for the link (default 'API documentation
            for this error').
        code (int): An internal code that customers can reference in their
            support request or to help them when searching for knowledge
            base articles related to this error (default ``None``).
