    Query string parameters are assumed to use standard form-encoding. Only
    parameters with values are returned. For example, given 'foo=bar&flag',
    this function would ignore 'flag' unless the `keep_blank_qs_values` option
    is set.

    Note:
        In addition to the standard HTML form-based method for specifying
        lists by repeating a given param multiple times, Falcon supports
        a more compact form in which the param may be given a single time
        but set to a ``list`` of comma-separated elements (e.g., 'foo=a,b,c').

        When using this format, all commas uri-encoded will not be treated by
        Falcon as a delimiter. If the client wants to send a value as a list,
        it must not encode the commas with the values.

        The two different ways of specifying lists may not be mixed in
        a single query string for the same parameter.

    Args:
        query_string (str): The query string to parse.
        keep_blank (bool): Set to ``True`` to return fields even if
            they do not have a value (default ``False``). For comma-separated
            values, this option also determines whether or not empty elements
            in the parsed list are retained.
        csv: Set to ``False`` in order to disable splitting query
            parameters on ``,`` (default ``True``). Depending on the user agent,
            encoding lists as multiple occurrences of the same parameter might
            be preferable. In this case, setting `parse_qs_csv` to ``False``
            will cause the framework to treat commas as literal characters in
            each occurring parameter value.
