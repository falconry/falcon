    """Extends *testtools.TestCase* to support WSGI integration testing.

    `TestBase` provides a base class that provides some extra plumbing to
    help simulate WSGI calls without having to actually host your API
    in a server.

    Note:
        If *testtools* is not available, *unittest* is used instead.

    Attributes:
        api (falcon.API): An API instance to target when simulating
            requests. Defaults to ``falcon.API()``.
        srmock (falcon.testing.StartResponseMock): Provides a callable
            that simulates the behavior of the *start_response* argument
            that the server would normally pass into the WSGI app. The
            mock object captures various information from the app's
            response to the simulated request.
        test_route (str): A simple, generated path that a test
            can use to add a route to the API.
