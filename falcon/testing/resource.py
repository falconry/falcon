    This class implements a simple test resource that can be extended
    as needed to test middleware, hooks, and the Falcon framework
    itself.

    Only noop ``on_get()`` and ``on_post()`` responders are implemented;
    when overriding these, or adding additional responders in child
    classes, they can be decorated with the
    :py:meth:`falcon.testing.capture_responder_args` hook in
    order to capture the *req*, *resp*, and *params* arguments that
    are passed to the responder. Responders may also be decorated with
    the :py:meth:`falcon.testing.set_resp_defaults` hook in order to
    set *resp* properties to default *status*, *body*, and *header*
    values.

    Keyword Arguments:
        status (str): Default status string to use in responses
        body (str): Default body string to use in responses
        json (dict): Default JSON document to use in responses. Will
            be serialized to a string and encoded as UTF-8. Either
            *json* or *body* may be specified, but not both.
        headers (dict): Default set of additional headers to include in
            responses

    Attributes:
        called (bool): Whether or not a req/resp was captured.
        captured_req (falcon.Request): The last Request object passed
            into any one of the responder methods.
        captured_resp (falcon.Response): The last Response object passed
            into any one of the responder methods.
        captured_kwargs (dict): The last dictionary of kwargs, beyond
            ``req`` and ``resp``, that were passed into any one of the
            responder methods.
