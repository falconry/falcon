    Makes an effort to parse Forwarded headers as specified by RFC 7239:

    - It checks that every value has valid syntax in general as specified

    - It un-escapes found escape sequences.
    - It does NOT validate 'by' and 'for' contents as specified in section

    - It does NOT validate 'host' contents (Host ABNF).
    - It does NOT validate 'proto' contents for valid URI scheme names.
