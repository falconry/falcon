        Keyword Args:
            expires (datetime): Specifies when the cookie should expire.
                By default, cookies expire when the user agent exits.

                (See also: RFC 6265, Section 4.1.2.1)
            max_age (int): Defines the lifetime of the cookie in
                seconds. By default, cookies expire when the user agent
                exits. If both `max_age` and `expires` are set, the
                latter is ignored by the user agent.

                Note:
                    Coercion to ``int`` is attempted if provided with
                    ``float`` or ``str``.

                (See also: RFC 6265, Section 4.1.2.2)

            domain (str): Restricts the cookie to a specific domain and
                any subdomains of that domain. By default, the user
                agent will return the cookie only to the origin server.
                When overriding this default behavior, the specified
                domain must include the origin server. Otherwise, the
                user agent will reject the cookie.

                Note:
                    Cookies do not provide isolation by port, so the domain
                    should not provide one. (See also: RFC 6265, Section 8.5)

                (See also: RFC 6265, Section 4.1.2.3)

            path (str): Scopes the cookie to the given path plus any
                subdirectories under that path (the "/" character is
                interpreted as a directory separator). If the cookie
                does not specify a path, the user agent defaults to the
                path component of the requested URI.

                Warning:
                    User agent interfaces do not always isolate
                    cookies by path, and so this should not be
                    considered an effective security measure.

                (See also: RFC 6265, Section 4.1.2.4)

            secure (bool): Direct the client to only return the cookie
                in subsequent requests if they are made over HTTPS
                (default: ``True``). This prevents attackers from
                reading sensitive cookie data.

                Note:
                    The default value for this argument is normally
                    ``True``, but can be modified by setting
                    :attr:`~.ResponseOptions.secure_cookies_by_default`
                    via :any:`App.resp_options`.

                Warning:
                    For the `secure` cookie attribute to be effective,
                    your application will need to enforce HTTPS.

                (See also: RFC 6265, Section 4.1.2.5)

            http_only (bool): The HttpOnly attribute limits the scope of the
                cookie to HTTP requests.  In particular, the attribute
                instructs the user agent to omit the cookie when providing
                access to cookies via "non-HTTP" APIs. This is intended to
                mitigate some forms of cross-site scripting. (default: ``True``)

                Note:
                    HttpOnly cookies are not visible to javascript scripts
                    in the browser. They are automatically sent to the server
                    on javascript ``XMLHttpRequest`` or ``Fetch`` requests.

                (See also: RFC 6265, Section 4.1.2.6)

            same_site (str): Helps protect against CSRF attacks by restricting
                when a cookie will be attached to the request by the user agent.
                When set to ``'Strict'``, the cookie will only be sent along
                with "same-site" requests.  If the value is ``'Lax'``, the
                cookie will be sent with same-site requests, and with
                "cross-site" top-level navigations.  If the value is ``'None'``,
                the cookie will be sent with same-site and cross-site requests.
                Finally, when this attribute is not set on the cookie, the
                attribute will be treated as if it had been set to ``'None'``.

                (See also: `Same-Site RFC Draft`_)

            partitioned (bool): Prevents cookies from being accessed from other
                subdomains. With partitioned enabled, a cookie set by
                https://3rd-party.example which is embedded inside
                https://site-a.example can no longer be accessed by
                https://site-b.example. While this attribute is not yet
                standardized, it is already used by Chrome.

            samesite (str): Allows to override the default 'Lax' same_site
                    setting for the unset cookie.

            domain (str): Restricts the cookie to a specific domain and
                    any subdomains of that domain. By default, the user
                    agent will return the cookie only to the origin server.
                    When overriding this default behavior, the specified
                    domain must include the origin server. Otherwise, the
                    user agent will reject the cookie.

                    Note:
                        Cookies do not provide isolation by port, so the domain
                        should not provide one. (See also: RFC 6265, Section 8.5)

                    (See also: RFC 6265, Section 4.1.2.3)

            path (str): Scopes the cookie to the given path plus any
                subdirectories under that path (the "/" character is
                interpreted as a directory separator). If the cookie
                does not specify a path, the user agent defaults to the
                path component of the requested URI.

                Warning:
                    User agent interfaces do not always isolate
                    cookies by path, and so this should not be
                    considered an effective security measure.

                client that the target resource is available in multiple

            type_hint(str): Provides a hint as to the media type of the
                result of dereferencing the link (default ``None``). As noted
                in RFC 5988, this is only a hint and does not override the
                Content-Type header returned when the link is followed.
