class App(falcon.app.App):
    """This class is the main entry point into a Falcon-based ASGI app.

    Each App instance provides a callable
    `ASGI <https://asgi.readthedocs.io/en/latest/>`_ interface
    and a routing engine  (for WSGI applications, see
    :class:`falcon.App`).

    Keyword Arguments:
        media_type (str): Default media type to use when initializing
            :py:class:`~.RequestOptions` and
            :py:class:`~.ResponseOptions`. The ``falcon``
            module provides a number of constants for common media types,
            such as ``falcon.MEDIA_MSGPACK``, ``falcon.MEDIA_YAML``,
            ``falcon.MEDIA_XML``, etc.
        middleware: Either a single middleware component object or an iterable
            of objects (instantiated classes) that implement the
            middleware component interface shown below.

            The interface provides support for handling both ASGI worker
            lifespan events and per-request events. However, because lifespan
            events are an optional part of the ASGI specification, they may or
            may not fire depending on your ASGI server.

            A lifespan event handler can be used to perform startup or shutdown
            activities for the main event loop. An example of this would be
            creating a connection pool and subsequently closing the connection
            pool to release the connections.

            Note:
                In a multi-process environment, lifespan events will be
                triggered independently for the individual event loop associated
                with each process.

            Note:
                The framework requires that all middleware methods be
                implemented as coroutine functions via `async def`. However,
                it is possible to implement middleware classes that support
                both ASGI and WSGI apps by distinguishing the ASGI methods
                with an `*_async` postfix (see also:
                :ref:`Middleware <middleware>`).

            It is only necessary to implement the methods for the events you
            would like to handle; Falcon simply skips over any missing
            middleware methods::

                class ExampleComponent:
                    async def process_startup(self, scope, event):
                        \"\"\"Process the ASGI lifespan startup event.

                        Invoked when the server is ready to start up and
                        receive connections, but before it has started to
                        do so.

                        To halt startup processing and signal to the server that it
                        should terminate, simply raise an exception and the
                        framework will convert it to a "lifespan.startup.failed"
                        event for the server.

                        Args:
                            scope (dict): The ASGI scope dictionary for the
                                lifespan protocol. The lifespan scope exists
                                for the duration of the event loop.
                            event (dict): The ASGI event dictionary for the
                                startup event.
                        \"\"\"

                        \"\"\"Process the ASGI lifespan shutdown event.

                        Invoked when the server has stopped accepting
                        connections and closed all active connections.

                        To halt shutdown processing and signal to the server
                        that it should immediately terminate, simply raise an
                        exception and the framework will convert it to a
                        "lifespan.shutdown.failed" event for the server.

                        Note:
                            Because Falcon routes each request based on
                            req.path, a request can be effectively re-routed
                            by setting that attribute to a new value from

            to use in lieu of the default engine.
            (See also: :ref:`Custom Routers <routing_custom>`)

        independent_middleware (bool): Set to ``False`` if response
            middleware should not be executed independently of whether or
            not request middleware raises an exception (default
            ``True``). When this option is set to ``False``, a middleware

            when that same component's ``process_request()`` (or that of
            a component higher up in the stack) raises an exception.

        cors_enable (bool): Set this flag to ``True`` to enable a simple
            CORS policy for all responses, including support for preflighted
            requests. An instance of :py:class:`..CORSMiddleware` can instead be
            passed to the middleware argument to customize its behaviour.

        sink_before_static_route (bool): Indicates if the sinks should be processed
            before (when ``True``) or after (when ``False``) the static routes.
            This has an effect only if no route was matched. (default ``True``)

    Attributes:
        req_options: A set of behavioral options related to incoming

            responses. (See also: :py:class:`~.ResponseOptions`)
        ws_options: A set of behavioral options related to WebSocket
            connections. (See also: :py:class:`~.WebSocketOptions`)
        router_options: Configuration options for the router. If a
            custom router is in use, and it does not expose any
            configurable options, referencing this attribute will raise
            an instance of ``AttributeError``.

    def add_error_handler(self, exception, handler=None):
        """Register a handler for one or more exception types.

        Error handlers may be registered for any exception type, including
        :class:`~.HTTPError` or :class:`~.HTTPStatus`. This feature
        provides a central location for logging and otherwise handling
        exceptions raised by responders, hooks, and middleware components.

        A handler can raise an instance of :class:`~.HTTPError` or
        :class:`~.HTTPStatus` to communicate information about the issue to
        the client.  Alternatively, a handler may modify `resp`
        directly.

        An error handler "matches" a raised exception if the exception is an
        instance of the corresponding exception type. If more than one error
        handler matches the raised exception, the framework will choose the
        most specific one, as determined by the method resolution order of the
        raised exception type. If multiple error handlers are registered for the
        *same* exception class, then the most recently-registered handler is
        used.

        For example, suppose we register error handlers as follows::

            app = App()
            app.add_error_handler(falcon.HTTPNotFound, custom_handle_not_found)
            app.add_error_handler(falcon.HTTPError, custom_handle_http_error)
            app.add_error_handler(Exception, custom_handle_uncaught_exception)
            app.add_error_handler(falcon.HTTPNotFound, custom_handle_404)

        If an instance of ``falcon.HTTPForbidden`` is raised, it will be
        handled by ``custom_handle_http_error()``. ``falcon.HTTPError`` is a
        superclass of ``falcon.HTTPForbidden`` and a subclass of ``Exception``,
        so it is the most specific exception type with a registered handler.

        If an instance of ``falcon.HTTPNotFound`` is raised, it will be handled
        by ``custom_handle_404()``, not by ``custom_handle_not_found()``, because
        ``custom_handle_404()`` was registered more recently.

        Note:

            By default, the framework installs three handlers, one for
            :class:`~.HTTPError`, one for :class:`~.HTTPStatus`, and one for
            the standard ``Exception`` type, which prevents passing uncaught
            exceptions to the WSGI server. These can be overridden by adding a
            custom error handler method for the exception type in question.

            When a generic unhandled exception is raised while
            handling a :ref:`WebSocket <ws>` connection, the default handler will
            close the connection with the standard close code ``1011`` (Internal
            Error). If your ASGI server does not support this code, the
            framework will use code ``3011`` instead; or you can customize
            it via the
            :attr:`~falcon.asgi.WebSocketOptions.error_close_code`
            property of :attr:`~.ws_options`.

            On the other hand, if an ``on_websocket()`` responder raises an
            instance of :class:`~falcon.HTTPError`, the default error handler
            will close the :ref:`WebSocket <ws>` connection with a framework
            close code derived by adding ``3000`` to the HTTP status code (e.g.,
            ``3404``)

        Args:
            exception (type or iterable of types): When handling a request,
                whenever an error occurs that is an instance of the specified
                type(s), the associated handler will be called. Either a single
                type or an iterable of types may be specified.

        Keyword Args:
            handler (callable): A coroutine function taking the
                form::

                    async def func(req, resp, ex, params, ws=None):
                        pass

                In the case of a WebSocket connection, the `resp` argument
                will be ``None``, while the `ws` keyword argument
                will receive the :class:`~falcon.asgi.WebSocket` object
                representing the connection.

                If the `handler` keyword argument is not provided to
                :meth:`~.add_error_handler`, the handler will default to
                ``exception.handle``, where ``exception`` is the error type
                specified above, and ``handle`` is a static method (i.e.,
                decorated with ``@staticmethod``) that accepts the params
