class Response(falcon.response.Response):
    """

    Attributes:
        sse (coroutine): A Server-Sent Event (SSE) emitter, implemented as
            an async coroutine function that returns an iterable
            of :py:class:`falcon.asgi.SSEvent` instances. Each event will be
            serialized and sent to the client as HTML5 Server-Sent Events.

        data (bytes): Byte string representing response content.

            Use this attribute in lieu of `body` when your content is
            already a byte string (of type ``bytes``).

            Warning:
                Always use the `body` attribute for text, or encode it
                first to ``bytes`` when using the `data` attribute, to
                ensure Unicode characters are properly encoded in the
                HTTP response.

            Note:
                Unlike the WSGI Response class, the ASGI Response class
                does not implement the side-effect of serializing
                the media object (if one is set) when the `data`
                attribute is read. Instead,
                :py:meth:`falcon.asgi.Response.render_body` should
                be used to get the correct content for the response.

        stream: An async iterator or generator that yields a series of
            byte strings that will be streamed to the ASGI server as a
            series of "http.response.body" events. Falcon will assume the
            body is complete when the iterable is exhausted or as soon as it
            yields ``None`` rather than an instance of ``bytes``.

            If the object assigned to :py:attr:`~.stream` holds any resources
            (such as a file handle) that must be explicitly released, the
            object must implement a close() method. The close() method will
            be called after exhausting the iterable.

            Note:
                In order to be compatible with Python 3.7+ and PEP 479,
                async iterators must return ``None`` instead of raising
                :py:class:`StopIteration`.

            Note:
                If the stream length is known in advance, you may wish to
                also set the Content-Length header on the response.
