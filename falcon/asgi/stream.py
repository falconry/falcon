class BoundedStream:
    """File-like input object for reading the body of the request, if any.

    This class implements coroutine functions for asynchronous reading or
    iteration, but otherwise provides an interface similar to that defined by
    :class:`io.IOBase`.

    If the request includes a Content-Length header, the number of bytes in the
    stream will be truncated to the length specified by the header. Otherwise,
    the stream will yield data until the ASGI server indicates that no more
    bytes are available.

    For large request bodies, the preferred method of using the stream object is
    as an asynchronous iterator. In this mode, each body chunk is simply yielded
    in its entirety, as it is received from the ASGI server. Because no data is
    buffered by the framework, this is the most memory-efficient way of reading
    the request body::

        # If the request body is empty or has already be consumed, the iteration
        #   will immediately stop without yielding any data chunks. Otherwise, a
        #   series of byte #   strings will be yielded until the entire request
        #   body has been yielded or the client disconnects.
        async for data_chunk in req.stream
            pass

    The stream object also supports asynchronous ``read()`` and
    ``readall()`` methods::

        # Read all of the data at once; use only when you are confident
        #   that the request body is small enough to not eat up all of
        #   your memory. For small bodies, this is the most performant
        #   option.
        data = await req.stream.readall()

        # ...or call read() without arguments
        data = await req.stream.read()

        # ...or read the data in chunks. You may choose to read more
        #   or less than 32 KiB as shown in this example. But note that
        #   this approach will generally be less efficient as compared
        #   to async iteration, resulting in more usage and
        #   copying of memory.
        while True:
            data_chunk = await req.stream.read(32 * 1024)
            if not data_chunk:
                break

    Warning:
        Apps may not use both ``read()`` and the asynchronous iterator
        interface to consume the same request body; the only time that
        it is safe to do so is when one or the other method is used to
        completely read the entire body *before* the other method is
        even attempted. Therefore, it is important to always call
        :meth:`~.exhaust` or :meth:`~.close` if a body has only been
        partially read and the remaining data is to be ignored.

    Note:
        The stream object provides a convenient abstraction over the series of
        body chunks contained in any ASGI "http.request" events received by the
        app. As such, some request body data may be temporarily buffered in
        memory during and between calls to read from the stream. The framework
        has been designed to minimize the amount of data that must be buffered
        in this manner.
