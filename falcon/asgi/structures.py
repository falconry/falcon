class SSEvent:
    """Represents a Server-Sent Event (SSE).

    Instances of this class can be yielded by an async generator in order to
    send a series of `Server-Sent Events`_ to the user agent.

    (See also: :attr:`falcon.asgi.Response.sse`)

    Keyword Args:
        data (bytes): Raw byte string to use as the ``data`` field for the
            event message. Takes precedence over both `text` and `json`.
        text (str): String to use for the ``data`` field in the message. Will
            be encoded as UTF-8 in the event. Takes precedence over `json`.
        json (object): JSON-serializable object to be converted to JSON and
            used as the ``data`` field in the event message.
        event (str): A string identifying the event type (AKA event name).
        event_id (str): The event ID that the User Agent should use for
            the `EventSource` object's last event ID value.
        retry (int): The reconnection time to use when attempting to send the
            event. This must be an integer, specifying the reconnection time
            in milliseconds.
        comment (str): Comment to include in the event message; this is
            normally ignored by the user agent, but is useful when composing
            a periodic "ping" message to keep the connection alive. Since this
            is a common use case, a default "ping" comment will be included
            in any event that would otherwise be blank (i.e., one that does
            not specify any fields when initializing the `SSEvent` instance.)

    Attributes:
        data (bytes): Raw byte string to use as the ``data`` field for the
            event message. Takes precedence over both `text` and `json`.
        text (str): String to use for the ``data`` field in the message. Will
            be encoded as UTF-8 in the event. Takes precedence over `json`.
        json (object): JSON-serializable object to be converted to JSON and
            used as the ``data`` field in the event message.
        event (str): A string identifying the event type (AKA event name).
        event_id (str): The event ID that the User Agent should use for
            the `EventSource` object's last event ID value.
        retry (int): The reconnection time to use when attempting to send the
            event. This must be an integer, specifying the reconnection time
            in milliseconds.
        comment (str): Comment to include in the event message; this is
            normally ignored by the user agent, but is useful when composing
            a periodic "ping" message to keep the connection alive. Since this
            is a common use case, a default "ping" comment will be included
            in any event that would otherwise be blank (i.e., one that does
            not specify any of these fields when initializing the
            `SSEvent` instance.)
