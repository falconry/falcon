    """Wrap an ASGI application in another coroutine.

    This utility is used to wrap the cythonized ``App.__call__`` in order to
    masquerade it as a pure-Python coroutine function.

    Conversely, if the ASGI callable is not detected as a coroutine function,
    the application server might incorrectly assume an ASGI 2.0 application
    (i.e., the double-callable style).

    In case the app class is not cythonized, this function is a simple
    passthrough of the original implementation.

    Args:
        asgi_impl(callable): An ASGI application class method.

    Returns:
        A pure-Python ``__call__`` implementation.
