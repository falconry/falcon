"""HTTP error classes.

This module implements a collection of `falcon.HTTPError`
specializations that can be raised to generate a 4xx or 5xx HTTP
response. All classes are available directly from the `falcon`
package namespace::

    import falcon

    class MessageResource(object):
        def on_get(self, req, resp):

            # ...

            raise falcon.HTTPBadRequest(
                'TTL Out of Range',
                'The message's TTL must be between 60 and 300 seconds, inclusive.'
            )

            # ...
