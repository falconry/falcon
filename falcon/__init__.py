"""Primary package for Falcon, the minimalist web API framework.

Falcon is a minimalist web API framework for building speedy web APIs and app
backends. The `falcon` package can be used to directly access most of
the framework's classes, functions, and variables::

    import falcon

    app = falcon.App()
